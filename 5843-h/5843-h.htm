    <h2>
      CHAPTER I.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you talked it over with her?&rsquo; said Mr. Ferrars, as his little
      slender wife met him under the beeches that made an avenue of the lane
      leading to Fairmead vicarage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes!&rsquo; was the answer, which the vicar was not slow to understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I cannot say I expected much from your conversation, and perhaps we ought
      not to wish it. We are likely to see with selfish eyes, for what shall we
      do without her?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear Albinia! You always taunted me with having married your sister as
      much as yourself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So I shall again, if you cannot give her up with a good grace.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I could have had my own way in disposing of her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps the hero of your own composition might be less satisfactory to
      her than is Kendal.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At least he should be minus the children!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I fancy the children are one great attraction. Do you know how many there
      are?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Three; but if Albinia knows their ages she involves them in a discreet
      haze. I imagine some are in their teens.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Impossible, Winifred, he is hardly five-and-thirty.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thirty-eight, he said yesterday, and he married very early. I asked
      Albinia if her son would be in tail-coats; but she thought I was laughing
      at her, and would not say. She is quite eager at the notion of being
      governess to the girls.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She has wanted scope for her energies,&rsquo; said Mr. Ferrars. &lsquo;Even spoiling
      her nephew, and being my curate, have not afforded field enough for her
      spirit of usefulness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is what I am afraid of.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of what, Winifred?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That it is my fault. Before our marriage, you and she were the whole
      world to each other; but since I came, I have seen, as you say, that the
      craving for work was strong, and I fear it actuates her more than she
      knows.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No such thing. It is a case of good hearty love. What, are you afraid of
      that, too?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I am. I grudge her giving her fresh whole young heart away to a man
      who has no return to make. His heart is in his first wife&rsquo;s grave. Yes,
      you may smile, Maurice, as if I were talking romance; but only look at
      him, poor man! Did you ever see any one so utterly broken down? She can
      hardly beguile a smile from him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;His melancholy is one of his charms in her eyes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So it may be, as a sort of interesting romance. I am sure I pity the poor
      man heartily, but to see her at three-and-twenty, with her sweet face and
      high spirits, give herself away to a man who looks but half alive, and
      cannot, if he would, return that full first love&mdash;have the charge of
      a tribe of children, be spied and commented on by the first wife&rsquo;s
      relations&mdash;Maurice, I cannot bear it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is not what we should have chosen,&rsquo; said her husband, &lsquo;but it has a
      bright side. Kendal is a most right-minded, superior man, and she
      appreciates him thoroughly. She has great energy and cheerfulness, and if
      she can comfort him, and rouse him into activity, and be the kind mother
      she will be to his poor children, I do not think we ought to grudge her
      from our own home.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You and she have so strong a feeling for motherless children!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thinking of Kendal as I do, I have but one fear for her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have many&mdash;the chief being the grandmother.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mine will make you angry, but it is my only one. You, who have only known
      her since she has subdued it, have probably never guessed that she has
      that sort of quick sensitive temper&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Maurice, Maurice! as if I had not been a most provoking, presuming
      sister-in-law. As if I had not acted so that if Albinia ever had a temper,
      she must have shown it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I knew you would not believe me, and I really am not afraid of her doing
      any harm by it, if that is what you suspect me of. No, indeed; but I fear
      it may make her feel any trials of her position more acutely than a placid
      person would.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oho! so you own there will be trials!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear Winifred, as if I had not sat up till twelve last night laying
      them before Albinia. How sick the poor child must be of our arguments,
      when there is no real objection, and she is so much attached! Have you
      heard anything about these connexions of his? Did you not write to Mrs.
      Nugent? I wish she were at home.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I had her answer by this afternoon&rsquo;s post, but there is nothing to tell.
      Mr. Kendal has only been settled at Bayford Bridge a few years, and she
      never visited any one there, though Mr. Nugent had met Mr. Kendal several
      times before his wife&rsquo;s death, and liked him. Emily is charmed to have
      Albinia for a neighbour.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Does she know nothing of the Meadows&rsquo; family?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing but that old Mrs. Meadows lives in the town with one unmarried
      daughter. She speaks highly of the clergyman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;John Dusautoy? Ay, he is admirable&mdash;not that I have done more than
      see him at visitations when he was curate at Lauriston.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is he married?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I fancy he is, but I am not sure. There is one good friend for Albinia
      any way!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And now for your investigations. Did you see Colonel Bury?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I did, but he could say little more than we knew. He says nothing could
      be more exemplary than Kendal&rsquo;s whole conduct in India, he only regretted
      that he kept so much aloof from others, that his principle and gentlemanly
      feeling did not tell as much as could have been wished. He has always been
      wrapped up in his own pursuits&mdash;a perfect dictionary of information.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We had found out that, though he is so silent. I should think him a most
      elegant scholar.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And a deep one. He has studied and polished his acquirements to the
      utmost. I assure you, Winifred, I mean to be proud of my brother-in-law.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What did you hear of the first wife?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was an early marriage. He went home as soon as he had sufficient
      salary, married her, and brought her out. She was a brilliant dark beauty,
      who became quickly a motherly, housewifely, common-place person&mdash;I
      should think there had been a poet&rsquo;s love, never awakened from.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The very thing that has always struck me when, poor man, he has tried to
      be civil to me. Here is a man, sensible himself, but who has never had the
      hap to live with sensible women.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When their children grew too old for India, she came into some little
      property at Bayford Bridge, which enabled him to retire. Colonel Bury came
      home in the same ship, and saw much of them, liked him better and better,
      and seems to have been rather wearied by her. A very good woman, he says,
      and Kendal most fondly attached; but as to comparing her with Miss
      Ferrars, he could not think of it for a moment. So they settled at
      Bayford, and there, about two years ago, came this terrible visitation of
      typhus fever.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I remember how Colonel Bury used to come and sigh over his friend&rsquo;s
      illness and trouble.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He could not help going over it again. The children all fell ill together&mdash;the
      two eldest were twin boys, one puny, the other a very fine fellow, and his
      father&rsquo;s especial pride and delight. As so often happens, the sickly one
      was spared, the healthy one was taken.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then Albinia will have an invalid on her hands!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Colonel says this Edmund was a particularly promising boy, and poor
      Kendal felt the loss dreadfully. He sickened after that, and his wife was
      worn out with nursing and grief, and sank under the fever at once. Poor
      Kendal has never held up his head since; he had a terrible relapse.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And,&rsquo; said Winifred, &lsquo;he no sooner recovers than he goes and marries our
      Albinia!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Two years, my dear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pray explain to me, Maurice, why, when people become widowed in any
      unusually lamentable way, they always are the first to marry again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Incorrigible. I meant to make you pity him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I did, till I found I had wasted my pity. Why could not these Meadowses
      look after his children! Why must the Colonel bring him here? I believe it
      was with malice prepense!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Colonel went to see after him, and found him so drooping and
      wretched, that he insisted on bringing him home with him, and old Mrs.
      Meadows and her daughter almost forced him to accept the invitation.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They little guessed what the Colonel would be at!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will be better now you have the Colonel to abuse,&rsquo; said her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And pray what do you mean to say to the General?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Exactly what I think.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And to the aunts?&rsquo; slyly asked the wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think I shall leave you all that correspondence. It will be too
      edifying to see you making common cause with the aunts.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That comes of trying to threaten one&rsquo;s husband; and here they come,&rsquo; said
      Winifred. &lsquo;Well, Maurice, what can&rsquo;t be cured must be endured. Albinia&rsquo;a
      heart is gone, he is a very good man, and spite of India, first wife, and
      melancholy, he does not look amiss!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ferrars smiled at the chary, grudging commendation of the tall,
      handsome man who advanced through the beech-wood, but it was too true that
      his clear olive complexion had not the line of health, that there was a
      world of oppression on his broad brow and deep hazel eyes, and that it was
      a dim, dreamy, reluctant smile that was awakened by the voice of the lady
      who walked by his side, as if reverencing his grave mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was rather tall, very graceful, and well made, but her features were
      less handsome than sweet, bright, and sensible. Her hair was nut-brown, in
      long curled waves; her eyes, deep soft grey, and though downcast under the
      new sympathies, new feelings, and responsibilities that crowded on her,
      the smile and sparkle that lighted them as she blushed and nodded to her
      brother and sister, showed that liveliness was the natural expression of
      that engaging face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Say what they would, it was evident that Albinia Ferrars had cast in her
      lot with Edmund Kendal, and that her energetic spirit and love of children
      animated her to embrace joyfully the cares which such a choice must impose
      on her.
    </p>
    <p>
      As might have been perceived by one glance at the figure, step, and
      bearing of Mr. Ferrars, perfectly clerical though they were, he belonged
      to a military family. His father had been a distinguished Peninsular
      officer, and his brother, older by many years, held a command in Canada.
      Maurice and Albinia, early left orphans, had, with a young cousin, been
      chiefly under the charge of their aunts, Mrs. Annesley and Miss Ferrars,
      and had found a kind home in their house in Mayfair, until Maurice had
      been ordained to the family living of Fairmead, and his sister had gone to
      live with him there, extorting the consent of her elder brother to her
      spending a more real and active life than her aunts&rsquo; round of society
      could offer her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The aunts lamented, but they could seldom win their darling to them for
      more than a few weeks at a time, even after their nephew Maurice had&mdash;as
      they considered&mdash;thrown himself away on a little lively lady of Irish
      parentage, no equal in birth or fortune, in their opinion, for the
      grandson of Lord Belraven.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had been very friendly to the young wife, but their hopes had all the
      more been fixed on Albinia; and even Winifred could afford them some
      generous pity in the engagement of their favourite niece to a retired East
      India Company&rsquo;s servant&mdash;a widower with three children.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The equinoctial sun had long set, and the blue haze of March east wind had
      deepened into twilight and darkness when Albinia Kendal found herself
      driving down the steep hilly street of Bayford. The town was not large nor
      modern enough for gas, and the dark street was only lighted here and there
      by a shop of more pretension; the plate-glass of the enterprising draper,
      with the light veiled by shawls and ribbons, the &lsquo;purple jars,&rsquo; green,
      ruby, and crimson of the chemist; and the modest ray of the grocer,
      revealing busy heads driving Saturday-night bargains.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How well I soon shall know them all,&rsquo; said Albinia, looking at her
      husband, though she knew she could not see his face, as he leant back
      silently in his corner, and she tried to say no more. She was sure that
      coming home was painful to him; he had been so willing to put it off, and
      to prolong those pleasant seaside days, when there had been such pleasant
      reading, walking, musing, and a great deal of happy silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down the hill, and a little way on level ground&mdash;houses on one side,
      something like hedge or shrubbery on the other&mdash;a stop&mdash;a gate
      opened&mdash;a hollow sound beneath the carriage, as though crossing a
      wooden bridge&mdash;trees&mdash;bright windows&mdash;an open door&mdash;and
      light streaming from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here is your home, Albinia,&rsquo; said that deep musical voice that she loved
      the better for the subdued melancholy of the tones, and the suppressed
      sigh that could not be hidden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And my children,&rsquo; she eagerly said, as he handed her out, and, springing
      to the ground, she hurried to the open door opposite, where, in the
      lamp-light, she saw, moving about in shy curiosity and embarrassment, two
      girls in white frocks and broad scarlet sashes, and a boy, who, as she
      advanced, retreated with his younger sister to the fireplace, while the
      elder one, a pretty, and rather formal looking girl of twelve, stood
      forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia held out her arms, saying, &lsquo;You are Lucy, I am sure,&rsquo; and eagerly
      kissed the girl&rsquo;s smiling, bright face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I am Lucy,&rsquo; was the well-pleased answer, &lsquo;I am glad you are come.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope we shall be very good friends,&rsquo; said Albinia, with the sweet smile
      that few, young or old, could resist. &lsquo;And this is Gilbert,&rsquo; as she kissed
      the blushing cheek of a thin boy of thirteen&mdash;&lsquo;and Sophia.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophia, who was eleven, had not stirred to meet her. She alone inherited
      her father&rsquo;s fine straight profile, and large black eyes, but she had the
      heaviness of feature that sometimes goes with very dark complexions. The
      white frock did not become her brown neck and arms, her thick black hair
      was arranged in too womanly a manner, and her head and face looked too
      large; moreover, there was no lighting-up to answer the greeting, and
      Albinia was disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor child, she thought, she is feeling deeply that I am an interloper, it
      will be different now her father is coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kendal was crossing the hall, and as he entered he took the hand and
      kissed the forehead of each of the three, but Sophia stood with the same
      half sullen indifference&mdash;it might be shyness, or sensibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How much you are grown!&rsquo; he said, looking at the children with some
      surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, though Albinia knew their ages, they were all on a larger scale
      than she had expected, and looked too old for the children of a man of his
      youthful appearance. Gilbert had the slight look of rapid growth; Lucy,
      though not so tall, and with a small, clear, bright face, had the air of a
      little woman, and Sophia&rsquo;s face might have befitted any age.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, papa,&rsquo; said Lucy; &lsquo;Gilbert has grown an inch-and-a-half since
      October, for we measured him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you been well, Gilbert?&rsquo; continued Mr. Kendal, anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have the toothache, said Gilbert, piteously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Happily, nothing more serious,&rsquo; thrust in Lucy; &lsquo;Mr. Bowles told Aunt
      Maria that he considers Gilbert&rsquo;s health much improved.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia asked some kind questions about the delinquent tooth, but the
      answers were short; and, to put an end to the general constraint, she
      asked Lucy to show her to her room.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a pretty bay-windowed room, and looked cheerful in the firelight.
      Lucy&rsquo;s tongue was at once unloosed, telling that Gilbert&rsquo;s tutor, Mr.
      Salsted, had insisted on his having his tooth extracted, and that he had
      refused, saying it was quite well; but Lucy gave it as her opinion that he
      much preferred the toothache to his lessons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where does Mr. Salsted live?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At Tremblam, about two miles off; Gilbert rides the pony over there every
      day, except when he has the toothache, and then he stays at home.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what do you do?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We went to Miss Belmarche till the end of our quarter, and since that we
      have been at home, or with grandmamma. Do you <i>really</i> mean that we
      are to study with you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should like it, my dear. I have been looking forward very much to
      teaching you and Sophia.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you, mamma.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The word was said with an effort as if it came strangely, but it thrilled
      Albinia&rsquo;s heart, and she kissed Lucy, who clung to her, and returned the
      caress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall tell Gilbert and Sophy what a dear mamma you are,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;Do
      you know, Sophy says she shall never call you anything but Mrs. Kendal;
      and I know Gilbert means the same.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let them call me whatever suits them best,&rsquo; said Albinia; &lsquo;I had rather
      they waited till they feel that they like to call me as you have done&mdash;thank
      you for it, dear Lucy. You must not fancy I shall be at all hurt at your
      thinking of times past. I shall want you to tell me of them, and of your
      own dear mother, and what will suit papa best.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy looked highly gratified, and eagerly said, &lsquo;I am sure I shall love
      you just like my own mamma.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Albinia, kindly; &lsquo;I do not expect that, my dear. I don&rsquo;t ask
      for any more than you can freely give, dear child. You must bear with
      having me in that place, and we will try and help each other to make your
      papa comfortable; and, Lucy, you will forgive me, if I am impetuous, and
      make mistakes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy&rsquo;s little clear black eyes looked as if nothing like this had ever
      come within her range of observation, and Albinia could sympathize with
      her difficulty of reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kendal was not in the drawing-room when they re-entered, there was
      only Gilbert nursing his toothache by the fire, and Sophy sitting in the
      middle of the rug, holding up a screen. She said something good-natured to
      each, but neither responded graciously, and Lucy went on talking, showing
      off the room, the chiffonieres, the ornaments, and some pretty Indian
      ivory carvings. There was a great ottoman of Aunt Maria&rsquo;s work, and a huge
      cushion with an Arab horseman, that Lucy would uncover, whispering, &lsquo;Poor
      mamma worked it,&rsquo; while Sophy visibly winced, and Albinia hurried it into
      the chintz cover again, lest Mr. Kendal should come. But Lucy had full
      time to be communicative about the household with such a satisfied,
      capable manner, that Albinia asked if she had been keeping house all this
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No; old Nurse kept the keys, and managed till now; but she went this
      morning.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy&rsquo;s mouth twitched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She was so very fond&mdash;&rsquo; continued Lucy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rsquo; burst out Sophy, almost the first word Albinia had heard from
      her; but no more passed, for Mr. Kendal came in, and Lucy&rsquo;s conversation
      instantly was at an end.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Before him she was almost as silent as the others, and he seldom addressed
      himself to her, only inquiring once after her grandmamma&rsquo;s health, and
      once calling Sophy out of the way when she was standing between the fire
      and&mdash;He finished with the gesture of command, whether he said &lsquo;Your
      mamma,&rsquo; none could tell.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was late, and the meal was not over before bed-time, when Albinia
      lingered to find remedies for Gilbert&rsquo;s toothache, pleased to feel herself
      making a commencement of motherly care, and to meet an affectionate glance
      of thanks from Mr. Kendal&rsquo;s eye. Gilbert, too, thanked her with less
      shyness than before, and was hopeful about the remedy; and with the
      feeling of having made a beginning, she ran down to tell Mr. Kendal that
      she thought he had hardly done justice to the children&mdash;they were
      fine creatures&mdash;something so sweet and winning about Lucy&mdash;she
      liked Gilbert&rsquo;s countenance&mdash;Sophy must have something deep and noble
      in her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lifted his head to look at her bright face, and said, &lsquo;They are very
      much obliged to you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You must not say that, they are my own.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will not say it again, but as I look at you, and the home to which I
      have brought you, I feel that I have acted selfishly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia timidly pressed his hand, &lsquo;Work was always what I wished,&rsquo; she
      said, &lsquo;if only I could do anything to lighten your grief and care.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave a deep, heavy sigh. Albinia felt that if he had hoped to have
      lessened the sadness, he had surely found it again at his own door. He
      roused himself, however, to say, &lsquo;This is using you ill, Albinia; no one
      is more sensible of it than I am.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never sought more than you can give,&rsquo; she murmured; &lsquo;I only wish to do
      what I can for you, and you will not let me disturb you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am very grateful to you,&rsquo; was his answer; a sad welcome for a bride.
      &lsquo;And these poor children will owe everything to you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish I may do right by them,&rsquo; said Albinia, fervently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The flower of the flock&rsquo;&mdash;began Mr. Kendal, but he broke off at
      once.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia had told Winifred that she could bear to have his wife&rsquo;s memory
      first with him, and that she knew that she could not compensate to him for
      his loss, but the actual sight of his dejection came on her with a chill,
      and she had to call up all her energies and hopes, and, still better, the
      thought of strength not her own, to enable her to look cheerfully on the
      prospect. Sleep revived her elastic spirits, and with eager curiosity she
      drew up her blind in the morning, for the first view of her new home.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was a veil&mdash;moisture made the panes resemble ground glass,
      and when she had rubbed that away, and secured a clear corner, her range
      of vision was not much more extensive. She could only see the grey outline
      of trees and shrubs, obscured by the heavy mist; and on the lawn below, a
      thick cloud that seemed to hang over a dark space which she suspected to
      be a large pond.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is very little to be gained by looking out here!&rsquo; Albinia
      soliloquized. &lsquo;It is not doing the place justice to study it on a misty,
      moisty morning. It looks now as if that fever might have come bodily out
      of the pond. I&rsquo;ll have no more to say to it till the sun has licked up the
      fog, and made it bright! Sunday morning&mdash;my last Sunday without
      school-teaching I hope! I famish to begin again&mdash;and I will make time
      for that, and the girls too! I am glad he consents to my doing whatever I
      please in that way! I hope Mr. Dusautoy will! I wish Edmund knew him
      better&mdash;but oh! what a shy man it is!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With a light step she went down-stairs, and found Mr Kendal waiting for
      her in the dining-room, his face brightening as she entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am sorry Bayford should wear this heavy cloud to receive you,&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It will soon clear,&rsquo; she answered, cheerfully. &lsquo;Have you heard of poor
      Gilbert this morning?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not yet.&rsquo; Then, after a pause, &lsquo;I have generally gone to Mrs. Meadows
      after the morning service,&rsquo; he said, speaking with constraint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will take me?&rsquo; said Albinia. &lsquo;I wish it, I assure you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was evidently what he wished her to propose, and he added, &lsquo;She must
      never feel herself neglected, and it will be better at once.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So much more cordial,&rsquo; said Albinia. &lsquo;Pray let us go!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They were interrupted by the voices of the girls&mdash;not unpleasing
      voices, but loud and unsubdued, and with a slight tone of provincialism,
      which seemed to hurt Mr. Kendal&rsquo;s ears, for he said, &lsquo;I hope you will tune
      those voices to something less unlike your own.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, the sisters appeared in the full and conscious rustling of
      new lilac silk dresses, which seemed to have happily carried off all
      Sophy&rsquo;s sullenness, for she made much more brisk and civil answers, and
      ran across the room in a boisterous manner, when her father sent her to
      see whether Gilbert were up.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a great clatter, and Gilbert chased her in, breathless and
      scolding, but the tongues were hushed before papa, and no more was heard
      than that the tooth was better, and had not kept him awake. Lucy seemed
      disposed to make conversation, overwhelming Albinia with needless
      repetitions of &lsquo;Mamma dear,&rsquo; and plunging into what Mrs. Bowles and Miss
      Goldsmith had said of Mr. Dusautoy, and how he kept so few servants, and
      the butcher had no orders last time he called. Aunt Maria thought he
      starved and tyrannized over that poor little sickly Mrs. Dusautoy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kendal said not one word, and seemed not to hear. Albinia felt as if
      she had fallen into a whirlpool of gossip; she looked towards him, and
      hoped to let the conversation drop, but Sophy answered her sister, and, at
      last, when it came to something about what Jane heard from Mrs. Osborn&rsquo;s
      Susan, Albinia gently whispered, &lsquo;I do not think this entertains your
      papa, my dear,&rsquo; and silence sank upon them all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia&rsquo;s next venture was to ask about that which had been her Sunday
      pleasure from childhood, and she turned to Sophy, and said, &lsquo;I suppose you
      have not begun to teach at the school yet!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy&rsquo;s great eyes expanded, and Lucy said, &lsquo;Oh dear mamma! nobody does
      that but Genevieve Durant and the monitors. Miss Wolte did till Mr.
      Dusautoy came, but she does not approve of him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lucy, you do not know what you are saying,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal, and again
      there was an annihilating silence, which Albinia did not attempt to
      disturb.
    </p>
    <p>
      At church time, she met the young ladies in the hall, in pink bonnets and
      sea-green mantillas over the lilac silks, all evidently put on for the
      first time in her honour, an honour of which she felt herself the less
      deserving, as, sensible that this was no case for bridal display, she wore
      a quiet dark silk, a Cashmere shawl, and plain straw bonnet, trimmed with
      white.
    </p>
    <p>
      With manifest wish for reciprocity, Lucy fell into transports over the
      shawl, but gaining nothing by this, Sophy asked if she did not like the
      mantillas? Albinia could only make civility compatible with truth by
      saying that the colour was pretty, but where was Gilbert? He was on a
      stool before the dining-room fire, looking piteous, and pronouncing his
      tooth far too bad for going to church, and she had just time for a fresh
      administration of camphor before Mr. Kendal came forth from his study, and
      gave her his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The front door opened on a narrow sweep, the river cutting it off from the
      road, and crossed by two wooden bridges, beside each of which stood a
      weeping-willow, budding with fresh spring foliage. Opposite were houses of
      various pretentious, and sheer behind them rose the steep hill, with the
      church nearly at the summit, the noble spire tapering high above, and the
      bells ringing out a cheerful chime. The mist had drawn up, and all was
      fresh and clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There go Lizzie and Loo!&rsquo; cried Lucy, &lsquo;and the Admiral and Mrs. Osborn.
      I&rsquo;ll run and tell them papa is come home.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy was setting off also, but Mr. Kendal stopped them, and lingered a
      moment or two, making an excuse of looking for a needless umbrella, but in
      fact to avoid the general gaze. As if making a desperate plunge, however,
      and looking up and down the broad street, so as to be secure that no
      acquaintance was near, he emerged with Albinia from the gate, and crossed
      the road as the chime of the bells changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We are late,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;You will prefer the speediest way, though it is
      somewhat steep.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The most private way, Albinia understood, and could also perceive that the
      girls would have liked the street which sloped up the hill, and thought
      the lilac and green insulted by being conducted up the steep, irregular,
      and not very clean bye-lane that led directly up the ascent, between
      houses, some meanly modern, some picturesquely ancient, with stone steps
      outside to the upper story, but all with far too much of pig-stye about
      them for beauty or fragrance. Lucy held up her skirts, and daintily picked
      her way, and Albinia looked with kindly eyes at the doors and windows,
      secretly wondering what friends she should find there.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lane ended in a long flight of more than a hundred shallow steps cut
      out in the soft stone of the hill, with landing-places here and there,
      whence views were seen of the rich meadow-landscape beyond, with villages,
      orchards, and farms, and the blue winding river Baye in the midst, woods
      rising on the opposite side under the soft haze of distance. On the other
      side, the wall of rock was bordered by gardens, with streamers of ivy or
      periwinkle here and there hanging down.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ascent ended in an old-fashioned stone stile; and here Sophy, standing
      on the step, proclaimed, with unnecessary loudness, that Mr. Dusautoy was
      carrying Mrs. Dusautoy across the churchyard. This had the effect of
      making a pause, but Albinia saw the rector, a tall, powerful man, rather
      supporting than actually carrying, a little fragile form to the low-browed
      door leading into the chancel on the north side. The church was handsome,
      though in the late style, and a good deal misused by eighteenth-century
      taste; and Albinia was full of admiration as Mr. Kendal conducted her
      along the flagged path.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was rather dismayed to find herself mounting the gallery stairs, and
      to emerge into a well-cushioned abode, with the shield-bearing angel of
      the corbel of an arch all to herself, and a very good view of the cobwebs
      over Mr. Dusautoy&rsquo;s sounding-board. It seemed to suit all parties,
      however, for Lucy and Sophia took possession of the forefront, and their
      father had the inmost corner, where certainly nobody could see him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just opposite to Albinia was a mural tablet, on which she read what
      revealed to her more of the sorrows of her household than she had guessed
      before:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &lsquo;To the memory of Lucy, the beloved wife of Edmund Kendal.

    <p>
      Then followed, in the original Greek, the words, &lsquo;Because I live, ye shall
      live also.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Four infants! how many hopes laid here! All the English-born children of
      the family had died in their cradles, and not only did compassion for the
      past affect Albinia, as she thought of her husband&rsquo;s world of hidden
      grief, but a shudder for the future came over her, as she remembered
      having read that such mortality is a test of the healthiness of a
      locality. What could she think of Willow Lawn? It was with a strong effort
      that she brought her attention back to Him Who controlleth the sickness
      that destroyeth at noon-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Dusautoy&rsquo;s deep, powerful intonations roused her wandering
      thoughts, and she was calmed and reassured by the holy Feast, in which she
      joined with her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kendal&rsquo;s fine face was calm and placid, as best she loved to look upon
      it, when they came out of church, and she was too happy to disturb the
      quiet by one word. Lively and animated as she was, there was a sort of
      repose and enjoyment in the species of respect exacted by his grave silent
      demeanour.
    </p>
    <p>
      If this could only have lasted longer! but he was taking her along an
      irregular street, and too soon she saw a slight colour flit across his
      cheek, and his eyebrows contract, as he unlatched a green door in a high
      wall, and entered a little flagged court, decorated by a stand destined
      for flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia caught the blush, and felt more bashful than she had believed was
      in her nature, but she had a warm-hearted determination that she would
      work down prejudices, and like and be liked by all that concerned him and
      his children. So she smiled at him, and went bravely on into the matted
      hall and up the narrow stairs, and made a laughing sign when he looked
      back at her ere he tapped at the sitting-room door.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was opened from within before he could turn the handle, and a shrill
      voice, exaggerating those of the girls, showered welcomes with such
      rapidity, that Albinia was seated at the table, and had been helped to
      cold chicken, before she could look round, or make much answer to
      reiterations of &lsquo;so very kind.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a small room, loaded with knicknacks and cushions, like a
      repository of every species of female ornamental handiwork in vogue for
      the last half century, and the luncheon-tray in the middle of all, ready
      for six people, for the two girls were there, and though Mr. Kendal stood
      up by the fire, and would not eat, he and his black image, reflected
      backwards and forwards in the looking-glass and in the little round
      mirror, seemed to take up more room than if he had been seated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Meadows was slight, shrunken, and gentle-looking, with a sweet tone
      in her voice, great softness of manner, and pretty blue eyes. Albinia only
      wished that she had worn mourning, it would have been so much more
      becoming than bright colours, but that was soon overlooked in gratitude
      for her affectionate reception, and in the warmth of feeling excited by
      her evident fondness and solicitude for Mr. Kendal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Meadows was gaily dressed in youthful fashion, such as evidently had
      set her off to advantage when she had been a bright, dark, handsome girl;
      but her hair was thin, her cheeks haggard, the colour hardened, and her
      forty years apparent, above all, in an uncomfortable furrow on the brow
      and round the mouth; her voice had a sharp distressed tone that grated
      even in her lowest key, and though she did not stammer, she could never
      finish a sentence, but made half-a-dozen disjointed commencements whenever
      she spoke. Albinia pitied her, and thought her nervous, for she was
      painfully assiduous in waiting on every one, scarcely sitting down for a
      minute before she was sure that pepper, or pickle, or new bread, or stale
      bread, or something was wanted, and squeezing round the table to help some
      one, or to ring the bell every third minute, and all in a dress that had a
      teasing stiff silken rustle. She offered Mr. Kendal everything in the
      shape of food, till he purchased peace by submitting to take a hard
      biscuit, while Albinia was not allowed her glass of water till all manner
      of wines, foreign and domestic, had been tried upon her in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conversation was not easy. Gilbert was inquired after, and his aunt spoke
      in her shrill, injured note, as she declared that she had done her utmost
      to persuade him to have the tooth extracted, and began a history of what
      the dentist ought to have done five years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      His grandmother softly pitied him, saying poor little Gibbie was such a
      delicate boy, and required such careful treatment; and when Albinia hoped
      that he was outgrowing his ill-health, she was amused to find that
      desponding compassion would have been more pleasing.
    </p>
    <p>
      There had been a transaction about a servant in her behalf: and Miss
      Meadows insisted on hunting up a note, searching all about the room, and
      making her mother and Sophy move from the front of two table-drawers, a
      disturbance which Sophy did not take with such placid looks as did her
      grandmother.
    </p>
    <p>
      The name of the maid was Eweretta Dobson, at which there was a general
      exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wonder what is the history of the name,&rsquo; said Albinia; &lsquo;it sounds like
      nothing but the diminutive of ewer. I hope she will not be the little
      pitcher with long ears.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kendal looked as much amused as he ever did, but no one else gave the
      least token of so much as knowing what she meant, and she felt as if she
      had been making a foolish attempt at wit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You need not call her so,&rsquo; was all that Mrs. Meadows said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do not like calling servants by anything but their true names,&rsquo; 
      answered Albinia; &lsquo;it does not seem to me treating them with proper
      respect to change their names, as if we thought them too good for them. It
      is using them like slaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy exclaimed, &lsquo;Why! grandmamma&rsquo;s Betty is really named Philadelphia.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia laughed, but was disconcerted by finding that she had really given
      annoyance. &lsquo;I beg your pardon,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;It is only a fancy of my own. I
      am afraid that I have many fancies for my friends to bear with. You see I
      have so fine a name of my own, that I have a fellow-feeling for those
      under the same affliction; and I believe some servants like an alias
      rather than be teased for their finery, so I shall give Miss Eweretta her
      choice between that and her surname.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old lady looked good-natured, and that matter blew over; but Miss
      Meadows fell into another complication of pros and cons about writing for
      the woman&rsquo;s character, looking miserably harassed whether she should
      write, or Mrs. Kendal, before she had been called upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia supposed that Mrs. Wolfe might call in the course of the week; but
      this Miss Meadows did not know, and she embarked in so many half speeches,
      and looked so mysterious and significant at her mother, that Albinia began
      to suspect that some dreadful truth was behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps,&rsquo; said the old lady, &lsquo;perhaps Mrs. Kendal might make it
      understood through you, my dear Maria, that she is ready to receive
      visits.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose they must be!&rsquo; said Albinia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You see, my dear, people would be most happy, but they do not know
      whether you have arrived. You have not appeared at church, as I may say.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed,&rsquo; said Albinia, much diverted by her new discoveries in the realms
      of etiquette, &lsquo;I was rather in a cupboard, I must allow. Ought we to have
      sailed up the aisle in state in the Grandison pattern? Are you ready?&rsquo; and
      she glanced up at her husband, but he only half heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Miss Meadows, fretfully; &lsquo;but you have not appeared as a bride.
      The straw bonnet&mdash;you see people cannot tell whether you are not
      incog, as yet&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      To refrain from laughing was impossible. &lsquo;My tarn cap,&rsquo; she exclaimed; &lsquo;I
      am invisible in it! What shall I do? I fear I shall never be producible,
      for indeed it is my very best, my veritable wedding-bonnet!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy looked as if she thought it not worth while to be married for no
      better a bonnet than that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Absurdity!&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he would but have given a good hearty laugh, thought Albinia, what a
      consolation it would be! but she considered herself to have had a lesson
      against laughing in that house, and was very glad when he proposed going
      home. He took a kind, affectionate leave of the old lady, who again looked
      fondly in big face, and rejoiced in his having recovered his looks.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they arrived at home, Lucy announced that she was just going to speak
      to Lizzie Osborn, and Sophy ran after her to a house of about the same
      degree as their own, but dignified as Mount Lodge, because it stood on the
      hill side of the street, while Mr. Kendal&rsquo;s house was for more gentility
      called &lsquo;Willow Lawn.&rsquo; Gilbert was not to be found; but at four o&rsquo;clock the
      whole party met at dinner, before the evening service.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert could eat little, and on going back to the fire to roast his cheek
      instead of going to church, was told by his father, &lsquo;I cannot have this
      going on. You must go to Mr. Bowles directly after breakfast to-morrow,
      have the tooth drawn, and then go on to Mr. Salsted&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tone was one that admitted of no rebellion. If Mr. Kendal interfered
      little, his authority was absolute where he did interfere, and Albinia
      could only speak a few kind words of encouragement, but the boy was vexed
      and moody, seemed half asleep when they came home, and went to bed as soon
      as tea was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy went to bed too, Mr. Kendal went to his study, and Albinia, after
      this day of novelty and excitement, drew her chair to the fire, and as
      Lucy was hanging wearily about, called her to her side, and made her talk,
      believing that there was more use in studying the girl&rsquo;s character than
      even in suggesting some occupation, though that was apparently the great
      want of the whole family on Sunday.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy&rsquo;s first confidence was that Gilbert had not been out alone, but with
      that Archibald Tritton. Mr. Tritton had a great farm, and was a sort of
      gentleman, and Gilbert was always after that Archy. She thought it &lsquo;very
      undesirable,&rsquo; and Aunt Maria had talked to him about it, but he never
      listened to Aunt Maria.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia privately thought that it must be a severe penance to listen to
      Aunt Maria, and took Gilbert&rsquo;s part. She supposed that he must be very
      solitary; it must be a melancholy thing to be a twin left alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And Edmund, dear Edmund, was always so kind and so fond of Gilbert!&rsquo; said
      Lucy. &lsquo;You would not have thought they were twins, Edmund was so much the
      tallest and strongest. It seemed so odd that Gilbert should have got over
      it, when he did not. Should you like to hear all about it, mamma?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Albinia&rsquo;s great wish to lift that dark veil, and Lucy began, with
      as much seriousness and sadness as could co-exist with the satisfaction
      and importance of having to give such a narration, and exciting emotion
      and pity. It was remarkable how she managed to make herself the heroine of
      the story, though she had been sent out of the house, and had escaped the
      infection. She spoke in phrases that showed that she had so often told the
      story as to have a set form, caught from her elders, but still it had a
      deep and intrinsic interest for the bride, that made her sit gazing into
      the fire, pressing Lucy&rsquo;s hand, and now and then sighing and shuddering
      slightly as she heard how there had been a bad fever prevailing in that
      lower part of the town, and how the two boys were both unwell one damp,
      hot autumn morning, and Lucy dwelt on the escape it had been that she had
      not kissed them before going to school. Sophy had sickened the same day,
      and after the tedious three weeks, when father and mother were spent with
      attendance on the three, Edmund, after long delirium, had suddenly sunk,
      just as they had hopes of him; and the same message that told Lucy of her
      brother&rsquo;s death, told her of the severe illness of both parents.
    </p>
    <p>
      The disease had done the work rapidly on the mother&rsquo;s exhausted frame, and
      she was buried a week after her boy. Lucy had seen the procession from the
      window, and thought it necessary to tell how she had cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kendal&rsquo;s had been a long illness; the first knowledge of his loss had
      caused a relapse, and his recovery had long been doubtful. As soon as the
      children were able to move, they were sent with Miss Meadows to Ramsgate,
      and Lucy had joined them there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The day before I went, I saw papa,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;I had gone home for some
      things that I was to take, and his room door was open, so he saw me on the
      stairs, and called me, for there was no fear of infection then. Oh, he was
      so changed! his hair all cut off, and his cheeks hollow, and he was quite
      trembling, as he lay back on pillows in the great arm-chair. You can&rsquo;t
      think what a shock it was to me to see him in such a state. He held out
      his arms, and I flung mine round his neck, and sobbed and cried. And he
      just said, so faintly, &ldquo;Take her away, Maria, I cannot bear it.&rdquo; I assure
      you I was quite hysterical.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You must have wished for more self-command,&rsquo; said Albinia, disturbed by
      Lucy&rsquo;s evident pleasure in having made a scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, but it was such a shock, and such a thing to see the house all empty
      and forlorn, with the windows open, and everything so still! Miss
      Belmarche cried too, and said she did not wonder my feelings overcame me,
      and <i>she</i> did not see papa.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! Lucy,&rsquo; said Albinia, fervently, &lsquo;how we must try to make him happy
      after all that he has gone through!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is what grandmamma said when she got his letter. &ldquo;I would be glad of
      anything,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that would bring back a smile to him.&rdquo; And Aunt
      Maria said she had done her best for him, but he must consult his own
      happiness; and so I say. When people talk to me, I say that papa is quite
      at liberty to consult his own happiness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy did not understand the tone, and went on patronizing. &lsquo;And if they
      say you look younger than they expected, I don&rsquo;t object to that at all. I
      had rather you were not as old as Aunt Maria, or Miss Belmarche.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who thinks me so young?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! Aunt Maria, and grandmamma, and Mrs. Osborn, and all; but I don&rsquo;t
      mind that, it is only Sophy who says you look like a girl. Aunt Maria says
      Sophy has an unmanageable temper.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you think you can let me find that out for myself?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thought you wanted me to tell you about everybody.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! but tell me of the good in your brother and sister.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know how,&rsquo; said Lucy. &lsquo;Gilbert is so tiresome, and so is Sophy. I
      heard Mary telling Jane, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure the new missus will have a heavy
      handful of those two.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what of yourself?&rsquo; said Albinia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; said Lucy, modestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kendal came in, and as Albinia looked at his pensive brow, she was
      oppressed by the thought of his sufferings in that dreary convalescence.
      At night, when she looked from her window, the fog hung white, like mildew
      over the pond, and she could not reason herself out of a spectral haunting
      fancy that sickness lurked in the heavy, misty atmosphere. She dreamt of
      it and the four babies, started, awoke, and had to recall all her higher
      trust to enable her vigour to chase off the oppressive imagination.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Fog greeted Mrs. Kendal&rsquo;s eyes as she rose, and she resolved to make an
      attack on the pond without loss of time. But Mr. Kendal was absorbed
      nearly all breakfast-time in a letter from India, containing a scrap in
      some uncouth character. As he finished his last cup of tea, he looked up
      and said, &lsquo;A letter from my old friend Penrose, of Bombay&mdash;an
      inscription in the Salsette caves.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you seen the Salsette caves?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She was longing to hear about them, but his horse was announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You said you would be engaged in the morning while I ride out, Albinia?&rsquo; 
      he said, &lsquo;I shall return before luncheon. Gilbert, you had better go at
      once to Mr. Bowles. I shall order your pony to be ready when you come
      back.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was not a word of remonstrance, though the boy looked very
      disconsolate, and began to murmur the moment his father had gone. Albinia,
      who had regarded protection at a dentist&rsquo;s one of the offices of the head
      of a family, though dismayed at the task, told Gilbert that she would come
      with him in a moment. The girls exclaimed that no one thought of going
      with him, and fearing she had put an affront on his manliness, she asked
      what he would like, but could get no answer, only when Lucy scolded him
      for lingering, he said, &lsquo;I thought <i>she</i> was going with me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Amiable,&rsquo; thought Albinia, as she ran up to put on her bonnet; &lsquo;but I
      suppose toothache puts people out of the pale of civilization. And if he
      is thankless, is not that treating me more like a mother?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps he had accepted her escort in hopes of deferring the evil hour,
      for he seemed discomfited to see her so quickly ready, and not grateful to
      his sisters, who hurried them by saying that Mr. Bowles would be gone out
      upon his rounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bowles was amazed at the sight of Mrs. Kendal, and so elaborate in
      compliments and assurances that Mrs. Bowles would do herself the honour of
      calling, that Albinia, pitying Gilbert, called his attention back.
    </p>
    <p>
      With him the apothecary was peremptory and facetious. &lsquo;He had expected
      that he should soon see him after his papa&rsquo;s return!&rsquo; And with a &lsquo;soon be
      over,&rsquo; he set him down, and Albinia bravely stood a desperate wringing of
      her hand at the tug of war. She was glad she had come, for the boy
      suffered a good deal, and was faint, and Mr. Bowles pronounced his mouth
      in no state for a ride to Tremblam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I must go,&rsquo; said Gilbert, as they walked home, &lsquo;I wish papa would listen
      to anything.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He would not wish you to hurt yourself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When papa says a thing&mdash;&rsquo; began Gilbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, Gilbert, you are quite right, and I hope you don&rsquo;t think I mean to
      teach you disobedience. But I do desire you, on my own responsibility, not
      to go and catch an inflammation in your jaw. I&rsquo;ll undertake papa.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert at once became quite another creature. He discoursed so much, that
      she had to make him restore the handkerchief to his mouth; he held open
      the gate, showed her a shoal of minnows, and tried to persuade her to come
      round the garden before going in, but she clapped her hands at him, and
      hunted him back into the warm room, much impressed and delighted by his
      implicit obedience to his father. With Lucy and Sophy, his remaining
      seemed likewise to make a great sensation; they looked at Mrs. Kendal and
      whispered, and were evidently curious as to the result of her audacity.
      Albinia, who had grown up with her brother Maurice and cousin Frederick,
      was more used to boys than to girls, and was already more at ease with her
      son than her daughters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert lent a ready hand with hammer and chisel, and boxes were opened,
      to the great delight and admiration of the girls. They were all very happy
      and busy setting things to rights, but Albinia was in difficulty how to
      bestow her books. There was an unaccountable scarcity both of books and
      book-cases; none were to be seen except that, in a chiffoniere in the
      drawing-room, there was a row in gilded bindings, chiefly Pope, Gray, and
      the like; and one which Albinia took out had pages which stuck together, a
      little pale blue string, faded at the end, and in the garlanded fly-leaf
      the inscription, &lsquo;To Miss Lucy Meadows, the reward of good conduct,
      December 20th, 1822.&rsquo; The book seemed rather surprised at being opened,
      and Albinia let it close itself as Lucy said, &lsquo;Those are poor mamma&rsquo;s
      books, all the others are in the study. Come in, and I&rsquo;ll show you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She threw open the door, and Albinia entered. The study was shaded with a
      mass of laurels that kept out the sun, and made it look chill and sad, and
      the air in it was close. The round library-table was loaded with desks,
      pocket-books, and papers, the mantelpiece was covered with letters, and
      book-shelves mounted to the ceiling, filled with the learned and the
      poetical of new and old times.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the fireplace hung what it needed not Lucy&rsquo;s whisper to point out, as
      &lsquo;Poor mamma&rsquo;s picture.&rsquo; It represented a very pretty girl, with dark eyes,
      brilliant colour, and small cherry mouth, painted in the exaggerated style
      usually called &lsquo;ridiculously like.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia&rsquo;s first feeling was that there was nothing in herself that could
      atone for the loss of so fair a creature, and the thought became more
      oppressive as she looked at a niche in the wall, holding a carved
      sandal-wood work-box, with a silver watch lying on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor Edmund&rsquo;s watch,&rsquo; said Lucy. &lsquo;It was given to him for a reward just
      before he was ill.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia tried to recover composure by reading the titles of the books.
      Suddenly, Lucy started and exclaimed, &lsquo;Come away. There he is!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why come away?&rsquo; said Albinia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I would not have him find me there for all the world.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In all her vexation and dismay, Albinia could not help thinking of
      Bluebeard&rsquo;s closet. Her inclination was to stay where she was, and take
      her chance of losing her head, yet she felt as if she could not bear to be
      found invading a sanctuary of past recollections, and was relieved to find
      that it was a false alarm, though not relieved by the announcement that
      Admiral and Mrs. Osborn and the Miss Osborns were in the drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Before luncheon&mdash;too bad!&rsquo; she exclaimed, as she hurried upstairs to
      wash off the dust of unpacking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ere she could hurry down, there was another inundation streaming across
      the hall, Mrs. Drury and three Miss Drurys, who, as she remembered, when
      they began to kiss her, were some kind of cousins.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was talk, but Albinia could not give entire attention; she was
      watching for Mr. Kendal&rsquo;s return, that she might guard Gilbert from his
      displeasure, and the instant she heard him, she sprang up, and flew into
      the hall. He could not help brightening at the eager welcome, but when she
      told him of Mr. Bowles&rsquo; opinion, he looked graver, and said, &lsquo;I fear you
      must not always attach credit to all Gilbert&rsquo;s reports.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Bowles told me himself that he must run no risk of inflammation.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You saw Mr. Bowles?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I went with Gilbert.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You? I never thought of your imposing so unpleasant a task on yourself. I
      fear the boy has been trespassing on your kindness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, indeed, he never asked me, but&mdash;&rsquo; with a sort of laugh to hide
      the warmth excited by his pleased, grateful look, &lsquo;I thought it all in the
      day&rsquo;s work, only natural&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She would have given anything to have had time to enjoy his epanchement de
      coeur at those words, bit she was obliged to add, &lsquo;Alas! there&rsquo;s all the
      world in the drawing-room!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Osborns and Drurys.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you want me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I ran away on the plea of calling you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll never do so again,&rsquo; was her inward addition, as his countenance
      settled into the accustomed fixed look of abstraction, and as an unwilling
      victim he entered the room with her, and the visitors were &lsquo;dreadful
      enough&rsquo; to congratulate him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia knew that it must be so unpleasant to him, that she blushed up to
      the roots of her hair, and could not look at anybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she recovered, the first comers were taking leave, but the second set
      stayed on and on till past luncheon-time, and far past her patience,
      before the room was at last cleared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert hurried in, and was received by his father with, &lsquo;You are very
      much obliged to her!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed I am,&rsquo; said Gilbert, in a winning, pleasant manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to be,&rsquo; said Albinia, affectionately laying her arm on
      his shoulder. &lsquo;And now for luncheon&mdash;I pitied you, poor fellow; I
      thought you must have been famished.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Anything not to have all the Drurys at luncheon,&rsquo; said Gilbert,
      confidentially, &lsquo;I had begun to wish myself at Tremblam.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By the bye,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal, waking as he sat down at the bottom of the
      table, &lsquo;how was it that the Drurys did not stay to luncheon?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Was that what they were waiting for?&rsquo; exclaimed Albinia. &lsquo;Poor people, I
      had no notion of that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They do have luncheon here in general,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal, as if not
      knowing exactly how it came to pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O yes,&rsquo; said Lucy; &lsquo;Sarah Anne asked me whether we ate wedding-cake every
      day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor Miss Sarah Anne!&rsquo; said Albinia, laughing. &lsquo;But one cannot help
      feeling inhospitable when people come so unconscionably early, and cut up
      all one&rsquo;s morning.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The door was again besieged by visitors, just as they were all going out
      to make the round of the garden, and it was not till half-past four that
      the succession ceased, and Albinia was left to breathe freely, and
      remember how often Maurice had called her to order for intolerance of
      morning calls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And not the only people I cared to see,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;the Dusautoys and
      Nugents. But they have too much mercy to call the first day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kendal looked as if his instinct were drawing him study-wards, but
      Albinia hung on his arm, and made him come into the garden. Though devoid
      of Winifred&rsquo;s gardening tastes, she was dismayed at the untended look of
      the flower-beds. The laurels were too high, and seemed to choke the narrow
      space, and the turf owed its verdant appearance to damp moss. She had made
      but few steps before the water squished under her feet, and impelled her
      to exclaim, &lsquo;What a pity this pond should not be filled up!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Filled up!&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, it would be so much less damp. One might drain it off into the
      river, and then we should get rid of the fog.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And she began actively to demonstrate the convenient slope, and the
      beautiful flower-bed that might be made in its place. Mr. Kendal answered
      with a few assenting sounds and complacent looks, and Albinia, accustomed
      to a brother with whom to assent was to act, believed the matter was in
      train, and that pond and fever would be annihilated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The garden opened into a meadow with a causeway leading to a canal bank,
      where there was a promising country walk, but the cruel visitors had left
      no time for exploring, and Albinia had to return home and hurry up her
      arrangements before there was space to turn round in her room&mdash;even
      then it was not what Winifred could have seen without making a face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kendal had read aloud to his wife in the evening during the stay at
      the sea-side, and she was anxious not to let the habit drop. He liked it,
      and read beautifully, and she thought it good for the children. She
      therefore begged him to read, catching him on the way to his study, and
      coaxing him to stay no longer than to find a book. He brought Schlegel&rsquo;s
      Philosophy of History. She feared that it was above the young ones, but it
      was delightful to herself, and the custom had better be established before
      it was perilled by attempts to adapt it to the children. Lucy and Sophy
      seemed astonished and displeased, and their whispers had to be silenced,
      Gilbert learnt his lessons apart. Albinia rallied her spirits, and
      insisted to herself that she did not feel discouraged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monday had gone, or rather Albinia had been robbed of it by visitors&mdash;now
      for a vigorous Tuesday. Her unpacking and her setting to rights were not
      half over, but as the surface was habitable, she resolved to finish at her
      leisure, and sacrifice no more mornings of study.
    </p>
    <p>
      So after she had lingered at the door, to delight Gilbert by admiring his
      pony, she returned to the dining-room, where the girls were loading a
      small table in the window with piles of books and exercises, and Lucy was
      standing, looking all eagerness to show off her drawings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, my dear, but first we had better read. I have been talking to your
      papa, and we have settled that on Wednesdays and Fridays we will go to
      church; but on these days we will begin by reading the Psalms and
      Lessons.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; said Lucy, &lsquo;we never do that, except when we are at grandmamma&rsquo;s.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pray are you too old or too young for it?&rsquo; said Albinia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We did it to please grandmamma,&rsquo; said Sophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now you will do it to please me,&rsquo; said Albinia, &lsquo;if for no better reason.
      Fetch your Bibles and Prayerbooks.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We shall never have time for our studies, I assure you, mamma,&rsquo; objected
      Lucy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is not your concern,&rsquo; said Albinia, her spirit rising at the girls&rsquo; 
      opposition. &lsquo;I wish for obedience.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy went, Sophy leant against the table like a post. Albinia regretted
      that the first shot should have been fired for such a cause, and sat
      perplexing herself whether it were worse to give way, or to force the
      girls to read Holy Scripture in such a mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy came flying down with the four books in her hands, and began
      officiously opening them before her sister, and exhorting her not to give
      way to sullenness&mdash;she ought to like to read the Bible&mdash;which of
      course made Sophy look crosser. The desire to establish her authority
      conquered the scruple about reverence. Albinia set them to read, and
      suffered for it. Lucy road flippantly; Sophy in the hoarse, dull, dogged
      voice of a naughty boy. She did not dare to expostulate, lest she should
      exasperate the tempers that she had roused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never mind,&rsquo; she thought, &lsquo;when the institution is fixed, they will be
      more amenable.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She tried a little examination afterwards, but not one answer was to be
      extracted from Sophy, and Lucy knew far less than the first class at
      Fairmead, and made her replies wide of the mark, with an air of
      satisfaction that nearly overthrew the young step-mother&rsquo;s patience.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Albinia took her Bible upstairs, she gave Sophy time to say what Lucy
      reported instantly on her entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear me, mamma, here is Sophy declaring that you ought to be a
      charity-schoolmistress. You wont be angry with her, but it is so funny!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you were at my charity school, Lucy,&rsquo; said Albinia, &lsquo;the first lesson
      I should give you would be against telling tales.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy subsided.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia turned to Sophy. &lsquo;My dear,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;perhaps I pressed this on
      when you were not prepared for it, but I have always been used to think of
      it as a duty.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy made no answer, but her moody attitude relaxed, and Albinia took
      comfort in the hope that she might have been gracious if she had known how
      to set about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose Miss Belmarche is a Roman Catholic,&rsquo; she said, wishing to
      account for this wonderful ignorance, and addressing herself to Sophy; but
      Lucy, whom she thought she had effectually put down, was up again in a
      moment like a Jack-in-a-box.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O yes, but not Genevieve. Her papa made it his desire that she should be
      brought up a Protestant. Wasn&rsquo;t it funny? You know Genevieve is Madame
      Belmarche&rsquo;s grand-daughter, and Mr. Durant was a dancing-master.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Madame Belmarche&rsquo;s father and brother were guillotined,&rsquo; continued Sophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! then she is an emigrant?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. Miss Belmarche has always kept school here. Our own mamma, and Aunt
      Maria went to school to her, and Miss Celeste Belmarche married Mr.
      Durant, a dancing-master&mdash;she was French teacher in a school in
      London where he taught, and Madame Belmarche did not approve, for she and
      her husband were something very grand in France, so they waited and waited
      ever so long, and when at last they did marry, they were quite old, and
      she died very soon; and they say he never was happy again, and pined away
      till he really did die of grief, and so Genevieve came to her grandmamma
      to be brought up.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor child! How old is she?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fifteen,&rsquo; said Lucy. &lsquo;She teaches in the school. She is not at all
      pretty, and such a queer little thing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Was her father French?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Sophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Lucy. &lsquo;You know nothing about it, Sophy. He was French, but of
      the Protestant French sort, that came to England a great many years ago,
      when they ran away from the Sicilian Vespers, or the Edict of Nantes, I
      don&rsquo;t remember which; only the Spitalfields weavers have something to do
      with it. However, at any rate Genevieve has got something in a drawer up
      in her own room that she is very secret about, and wont show to anybody.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think it is something that somebody was killed with,&rsquo; said Sophy, in a
      low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear me, if it is, I am sure it is quite wicked to keep it. I shall be
      quite afraid to go into her room, and you know I slept there all the time
      of the fever.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It did not hurt you,&rsquo; said Sophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia had been strongly interested by the touching facts, so
      untouchingly narrated, and by the characteristic account of the Huguenot
      emigration, but it suddenly occurred to her that she was promoting gossip,
      and she returned to business. Lucy showed off her attainments with her
      usual self-satisfaction. They were what might be expected from a
      second-rate old-fashioned young ladies&rsquo; school, where nothing was good but
      the French pronunciation. She was evidently considered a great proficient,
      and her glib mediocrity was even more disheartening than the ungracious
      carelessness or dulness&mdash;there was no knowing which&mdash;that made
      her sister figure wretchedly in the examination. However, there was little
      time&mdash;the door-bell rang at a quarter to twelve, and Mrs. Wolfe was
      in the drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I told you so,&rsquo; whispered Lucy, exultingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is unbearable,&rsquo; cried Albinia. &lsquo;I shall give notice that I am always
      engaged in the morning.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She desired each young lady to work a sum in her absence, and left them to
      murmur, if they were so disposed. Perhaps it was Lucy&rsquo;s speech that made
      her inflict the employment; at any rate, her spirit was not as serene as
      she could have desired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kendal was quite willing that she should henceforth shut her door
      against company in the morning; that is to say, he bowed his head
      assentingly. She was begging him to take a walk with her, when, at another
      sound of the bell, he made a precipitate retreat into his study. The
      visitors were the Belmarche family. The old lady was dark and withered,
      small, yet in look and air, with a certain nobility and grandeur that
      carried Albinia back in a moment to the days of hoops and trains, of
      powder and high-heeled shoes, and made her feel that the sweeping courtesy
      had come straight from the days of Marie Antoinette, and that it was an
      honour and distinction conferred by a superior&mdash;superior, indeed, in
      all the dignity of age, suffering, and constancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia blushed, and took her hand with respect very unlike the
      patronizing airs of Bayford Bridge towards &lsquo;poor old Madame Belmarche,&rsquo; 
      and with downcast eyes, and pretty embarrassment, heard the stately
      compliments of the ancien regime.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Belmarche was not such a fine specimen of Sevres porcelain as her
      mother. She was a brown, dried, small woman, having lost, or never
      possessed, her country&rsquo;s taste in dress, and with a rusty bonnet over the
      tight, frizzly curls of her front, too thin and too scantily robed to have
      any waist, and speaking English too well for the piquant grace of her
      mother&rsquo;s speech. Poor lady! born an exile, she had toiled, and struggled
      for a whole lifetime to support her mother; but though care had worn her
      down, there was still vivacity in her quick little black eyes, and though
      her teeth were of a dreadful colour, her laugh was so full of life and
      sweetness, that Albinia felt drawn towards her in a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Silent and demure, plainly dressed in an old dark merino, and a
      white-ribboned faded bonnet, sat a little figure almost behind her
      grandmother. Her face had the French want of complexion, but the eyes were
      of the deepest, most lustrous hue of grey, almost as dark as the pupils,
      and with the softness of long dark eyelashes&mdash;beautiful eyes, full of
      light and expression&mdash;and as she moved towards the table, there was a
      finish and delicacy about the whole form and movements, that made her a
      most pleasing object.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Albinia could not improve her acquaintance, for in flowed another
      party of visitors, and Madame curtsied herself out again, Albinia
      volunteering that she would soon come to see her, and being answered, &lsquo;You
      will do me too much honour.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Another afternoon devoured by visitors! Every one seemed to have come
      except the persons who would have been most welcome, Mr. Dusautoy, and
      Winifred&rsquo;s friends, the Nugents.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, at four o&rsquo;clock, she had shaken hands with the last guest, she gave
      a hearty yawn, jumped up and shook herself, as she exclaimed, &lsquo;There!
      There! that is done! I wonder whether your papa would come out now?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is in his study,&rsquo; said the girls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia thought of knocking and calling at the door, but somehow it seemed
      impossible, and she decided on promenading past his window to show that
      she was ready for him. But alas! those evergreens! She could not see in,
      and probably he could not see out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ha!&rsquo; cried Lucy, as they pursued their walk into the kitchen garden,
      &lsquo;here are some asparagus coming up. Grandmamma always has our first
      asparagus.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia was delighted to find such an opening. Out came her knife&mdash;they
      would cut the heads and take them up at once; but when the tempting
      white-stalked, pink-tipped bundle had been made up and put into a basket,
      a difficulty arose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll call the boy to take it,&rsquo; said Lucy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What, when we are going ourselves?&rsquo; said Albinia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! but we can&rsquo;t.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why? Do you think we shall break down under the weight?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O no, but people will stare.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why&mdash;what should they stare at?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It looks <i>so</i> to carry a basket&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia burst into one of her merriest peals of laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not carry a basket! My dear, I have looked <i>so</i> all the days of my
      life. Bayford must endure the spectacle, so it may as well begin at once.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But, dear mamma&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not asking you to carry it. O no, I only hope you don&rsquo;t think it too
      ungenteel to walk with me. But the notion of calling a boy away from his
      work, to carry a couple of dozen asparagus when an able-bodied woman is
      going that way herself!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia was so tickled that she could hardly check herself, even when she
      saw Lucy looking distressed and hurt, and little laughs would break out
      every moment as she beheld the young lady keeping aloof, as if ashamed of
      her company, turning towards the steep church steps, willing at least to
      hide the dreadful sight from the High Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as they had entered the narrow alley, they heard a hasty tread, and
      almost running over them with his long strides, came Mr. Dusautoy. He
      brought himself up short, just in time, and exclaimed, &lsquo;I beg your pardon&mdash;Mrs.
      Kendal, I believe. Could you be kind enough to give me a glass of brandy?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia gave a great start, as well she might.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was going to fetch one,&rsquo; quickly proceeded Mr. Dusautoy, &lsquo;but your
      house is nearer. A poor man&mdash;there&mdash;just come home&mdash;been on
      the tramp for work&mdash;quite exhausted&mdash;&rsquo; and he pointed to one of
      the cottages.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll fetch it at once,&rsquo; cried Albinia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; he said, as they crossed the street. &lsquo;This poor fellow has
      had nothing all day, has walked from Hadminster&mdash;just got home, sank
      down quite worn out, and there is nothing in the house but dry bread. His
      wife wants something nearly as much as he does.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In the excitement, Albinia utterly forgot all scruples about &lsquo;Bluebeard&rsquo;s
      closet.&rsquo; She hurried into the house, and made but one dash, standing
      before her astonished husband&rsquo;s dreamy eyes, exclaiming, &lsquo;Pray give me the
      key of the cellaret; there&rsquo;s a poor man just come home, fainting with
      exhaustion, Mr. Dusautoy wants some brandy for him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Like a man but half awake, obeying an apparition, Mr. Kendal put his hand
      into his pocket and gave her the key. She was instantly opening the
      cellaret, seeking among the bottles, and asking questions all the time.
      She proposed taking a jug of the kitchen-tea then in operation, and Mr.
      Dusautoy caught at the idea, so that poor Lucy beheld the dreadful
      spectacle of the vicar bearing a can full of steaming tea, and Mrs. Kendal
      a small cup with the &lsquo;spirituous liquor.&rsquo; What was the asparagus to this?
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia told her to go on to Mrs. Meadows&rsquo;, and that she should soon
      follow. She intended to have gone the moment that she had carried in the
      cup, leaving Mr. Dusautoy in the cottage, but the poor trembling
      frightened wife needed woman&rsquo;s sympathy and soothing, and she waited to
      comfort her, and to see the pair more able to enjoy the meeting, in their
      tidy, but bare and damp-looking cottage. She promised broth for the
      morrow, and took her leave, the vicar coming away at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; he said, warmly, as they came out, and turned to mount the
      hill together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;May I go and call on them again?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It will be very kind in you. Poor Simkins is a steady, good sort of
      fellow, but a clumsy workman, down-hearted, and with poor health, and
      things have been untoward with him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;People, who do not prosper in the world are not always the worst,&rsquo; said
      Albinia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, indeed, and these are grateful, warm-hearted people that you will
      like, if you can get over the poor woman&rsquo;s lackadaisical manner. But you
      are used to all that,&rsquo; he added, smiling. &lsquo;I see you know what poor folk
      are made of.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have been living among them nearly all my days,&rsquo; said Albinia. &lsquo;I hope
      you will give me something to do, I should be quite forlorn without it;&rsquo; 
      and she looked up to his kind, open face, as much at home with him as if
      she had known, him for years.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fanny&mdash;my wife&mdash;shall find work for you,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;You must
      excuse her calling on you, she is never off the sofa, but&mdash;&rsquo; And what
      a bright look he gave! as much as to say that his wife <i>on</i> the sofa
      was better than any one else <i>off</i>. &lsquo;I was hoping to call some of
      these afternoons,&rsquo; he continued, &lsquo;but I have had little time, and Fanny
      thought your door was besieged enough already.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; said Albinia; &lsquo;I own I thought it was your kindness in
      leaving me a little breathing time. And would Mrs. Dusautoy be able to see
      me if I were to call?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She would be delighted. Suppose you were to come in at once.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish I could, but I must go on to Mrs. Meadows&rsquo;. If I were to come
      to-morrow?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Any time&mdash;any time,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;She is always at home, and she has
      been much better since we came here. We were too much in the town at
      Lauriston.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dusautoy, having a year ago come out of the diocese where had been
      Albinia&rsquo;s home, they had many common friends, and plunged into
      &lsquo;ecclesiastical intelligence,&rsquo; with a mutual understanding of the topics
      most often under discussion, that made Albinia quite in her element. &lsquo;A
      great Newfoundland dog of a man in size, and countenance, and kindness,&rsquo; 
      thought she. &lsquo;If his wife be worthy of him, I shall reck little of all the
      rest.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her tread the gayer for this resumption of old habits, she proceeded to
      Mrs. Meadows&rsquo;, where the sensation created by her poor little basket
      justified Lucy&rsquo;s remonstrance. There were regrets, and assurances that the
      girl could have come in a moment, and that she need not have troubled
      herself, and her laughing declarations that it was no trouble were
      disregarded, except that the old lady said, in gentle excuse to her
      daughter, that Mrs. Kendal had always lived in the country, where people
      could do as they pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I mean to do as I please here,&rsquo; said Albinia, laughing; but the speech
      was received with silent discomfiture that made her heartily regret it.
      She disdained to explain it away; she was beginning to hold Mrs. and Miss
      Meadows too cheap to think it worth while.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Mrs. Meadows, as if yielding up the subject, &lsquo;things may be
      different from what they were in my time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! mamma&mdash;Mrs. Kendal&mdash;I am sure&mdash;&rsquo; Albinia let Maria
      flounder, but she only found her way out of the speech with &lsquo;Well! and is
      not it the most extraordinary!&mdash;Mr. Dusautoy&mdash;so rude&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should not wonder if you found me almost as extraordinary as Mr.
      Dusautoy,&rsquo; said Albinia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why would Miss Meadows always nettle her into saying exactly the wrong
      thing, so as to alarm and distress the old lady? That want of
      comprehension of playfulness was a strangely hard trial. She turned to
      Mrs. Meadows and tried to reassure her by saying, &lsquo;You know I have been
      always in the clerical line myself, so I naturally take the part of the
      parson.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, my dear,&rsquo; said Mrs. Meadows. &lsquo;I dare say Mr. Dusautoy is a very good
      man, but I wish he would allow his poor delicate wife more butcher&rsquo;s meat,
      and I don&rsquo;t think it looks well to see the vicarage without a
      man-servant.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia finally made her escape, and while wondering whether she should
      ever visit that house without tingling with irritation with herself and
      with the inmates, Lucy exclaimed, &lsquo;There, you see I was right. Grandmamma
      and Aunt Maria were surprised when I told them that you said you were an
      able-bodied woman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      What would not Albinia have given for Winifred to laugh with her? What to
      do now she did not know, so she thought it best not to hear, and to ask
      the way to a carpenter&rsquo;s shop to order some book-shelves.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was more uncomfortable after she came home, for by the sounds when Mr.
      Kendal next emerged from his study, she found that he had locked himself
      in, to guard against further intrusion. And when she offered to return to
      him the key of the cellaret, he quietly replied that he should prefer her
      retaining it,&mdash;not a formidable answer in itself, but one which,
      coupled with the locking of the door, proved to her that she might do
      anything rather than invade his privacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Maurice&rsquo;s study was the thoroughfare of the household, the place for
      all parish preparations unpresentable in the drawing-room, and Albinia was
      taken by surprise. She grew hot and cold. Had she done anything wrong?
      Could he care for her if he could lock her out?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will not be morbid, I will not be absurd,&rsquo; said she to herself, though
      the tears stood in her eyes. &lsquo;Some men do not like to be rushed in upon!
      It may be only habit. It may have been needful here. It is base to take
      petty offences, and set up doubts.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And Mr. Kendal&rsquo;s tender manner when they were again together, his gentle
      way of addressing her, and a sort of shy caress, proved that he was far
      from all thought of displeasure; nay, he might be repenting of his
      momentary annoyance, though he said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia went to inquire after the sick man at her first leisure moment,
      and while talking kindly to the wife, and hearing her troubles, was
      surprised at the forlorn rickety state of the building, the broken
      pavement, damp walls, and door that would not shut, because the frame had
      sunk out of the perpendicular.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t you ask your landlord to do something to the house?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is of no use, ma&rsquo;am, Mr. Pettilove never will do nothing. Perhaps if
      you would be kind enough to say a word to him, ma&rsquo;am&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Pettilove, the lawyer? I&rsquo;ll try if Mr. Kendal can say anything to
      him. It really is a shame to leave a house in this condition.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Thanks were so profuse, that she feared that she was supposed to possess
      some power of amelioration. The poor woman even insisted on conducting her
      up a break-neck staircase to see the broken ceiling, whence water often
      streamed in plentifully from the roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mind full of designs against the cruel landlord, she speeded up the
      hill, exhilarated by each step she took into the fresh air, to the
      garden-gate, which she was just unhasping when the hearty voice of the
      Vicar was heard behind her. &lsquo;Mrs. Kendal! I told Fanny you would come.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of taking her to the front door he conducted her across a sloping
      lawn towards a French window open to the bright afternoon sunshine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here she is, here is Mrs. Kendal!&rsquo; he said, sending his voice before him,
      as they came in sight of the pretty little drawing-room, where through the
      gay chintz curtains, she saw the clear fire shining upon half-a-dozen
      school girls, ranged opposite to a couch. &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; as he perceived them,
      &lsquo;shall I take her for a turn in the garden while you finish your lesson?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One moment, if you please. I did not know it was so late,&rsquo; and a face as
      bright as all the rest was turned towards the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! give her her scholars, and she never knows how time passes,&rsquo; said Mr.
      Dusautoy. &lsquo;But step this way, and I&rsquo;ll show you the best view in Bayford.&rsquo; 
      He took her up a step or two, to a little turfed mound, where there was a
      rustic seat commanding the whole exquisite view of river, vale, and
      woodland, with the church tower rising in the foreground. The wind blew
      pleasantly, chasing the shadows of the clouds across the open space.
      Albinia was delighted to feel it fan her brow, and her eager exclamations
      contented Mr. Dusautoy. &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;it was all Fanny&rsquo;s notion. She
      planned it all last summer when I took her round the garden. It is
      wonderful what an eye she has! I only hope when the dry weather comes,
      that I shall be able to get her up there to enjoy it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      On coming down they found that Mrs. Dusautoy had dismissed her class, and
      come out to a low, long-backed sloping garden-seat at the window. She was
      very little and slight, a mere doll in proportion to her great husband,
      who could lift her as easily and tenderly as a baby, paying her a sort of
      reverential deference and fond admiration that rendered them a beautiful
      sight, in such full, redoubled measure was his fondness repaid by the
      little, clever, fairy-looking woman, with her playful manner, high
      spirits, keen wit, and the active habits that even confirmed invalidism
      could not destroy. She had small deadly white hands, a fair complexion,
      that varied more than was good for her, pretty, though rather sharp and
      irregular features, and hazel eyes dancing with merriment, and face and
      figure at some years above thirty, would have suited a girl of twenty. To
      see Mr. Dusautoy bringing her footstools, shawls, and cushions, and to
      remember the accusation of starvation, was almost irresistibly ludicrous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, John, you had better have been giving Mrs. Kendal a chair all this
      time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mrs. Kendal will excuse,&rsquo; said Mr. Dusautoy, as he brought her a seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mrs. Kendal has excused,&rsquo; said Mrs. Dusautoy, bursting into a merry fit
      of laughter. &lsquo;Oh, I never heard anything more charming than your
      introduction! I beg your pardon, but I laughed last evening till I was
      worn out, and waked in the night laughing again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was exhilarating to find that any one laughed at Bayford, and Albinia
      partook of the mirth with all her heart. &lsquo;Never was an address more
      gratifying to me!&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was like him! so unlike Bayford! So bold a venture!&rsquo; continued Mrs.
      Dusautoy amid peals of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is there to laugh at?&rsquo; said Mr. Dusautoy, putting on a look between
      merriment and simplicity. &lsquo;What else could I have done? I should have done
      the same whoever I had met.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! now he is afraid of your taking it as too great a compliment! To do
      him justice I believe he would, but the question is, what answer he would
      have had.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nobody could have refused&mdash;&rsquo; began Albinia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; cried Mrs. Dusautoy. &lsquo;Little you know Bayford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fanny! Fanny! this is too bad. Madame Belmarche&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Would have had nothing but eau sucre! No, John, decidedly you and Simkins
      fell upon your legs, and you had better take credit for your &ldquo;admirable
      sagacity.&rdquo;&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I like the people,&rsquo; said Albinia, &lsquo;but they never can be well while they
      live in such a shocking place. It is quite a disgrace to Bayford.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is in a sad state,&rsquo; said Mr. Dusautoy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know I should like to set my brother upon that Mr. Pettilove, who they
      say will do nothing,&rsquo; exclaimed Albinia.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Vicar was going to have said something, but a look from his wife
      checked him. Albinia was sorry for it, as she detected a look of
      suppressed amusement on Mrs. Dusautoy&rsquo;s face. &lsquo;I mean to ask Mr. Kendal
      what can be done,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;and in the meantime, to descend from what we
      can&rsquo;t do to what we can. Mr. Dusautoy told me to come to you for orders.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I told Mr. Dusautoy that I should give you none.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! that is hard.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you could have heard him! He thought he <i>had</i> got a working lady
      at last, and he would have had no mercy upon you. One would have imagined
      that Mr. Kendal had brought you here for his sole behoof!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then I shall look to you, Mr. Dusautoy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I believe she is quite right,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;She says you ought to
      undertake nothing till you have had time to see what leisure you have to
      give us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nay, I have been used to think the parish my business, home my leisure.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Mrs. Dusautoy, &lsquo;but then you were the womankind of the clergy,
      now you are a laywoman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think you have work at home,&rsquo; said the Vicar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Work, but not work <i>enough!</i>&rsquo; cried Albinia. &lsquo;The girls will help
      me; only tell me what I may do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I say, &ldquo;what you can,&rdquo;&rsquo; said Mrs. Dusautoy. &lsquo;You see before you a
      single-handed man. Only two of the ladies here can be called coadjutors,
      one being poor little Genevieve Durant, the other the bookseller&rsquo;s
      daughter, Clarissa Richardson, who made all the rest fly off. All the
      others do what good they mean to do according to their own sweet will,
      free and independent women, and we can&rsquo;t have any district system, so I
      think you can only do what just comes to hand.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Most heartily did Albinia undertake all that Mrs. Dusautoy would let her
      husband assign to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, John is a strong temptation,&rsquo; said the bright little invalid, &lsquo;but
      you must let Mrs. Kendal find out in a month&rsquo;s time whether she has work
      enough.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I could think my wise brother Maurice had been cautioning you,&rsquo; said
      Albinia, taking leave as of an old friend, for indeed she felt more at
      home with Mrs. Dusautoy than with any acquaintance she had made in
      Bayford.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia told her husband of the state of the cottages, and railed at Mr.
      Pettilove much to her own satisfaction. Mr. Kendal answered, &lsquo;He would see
      about it,&rsquo; an answer of which Albinia had yet to learn the import.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      There are some characters so constituted, that of them the old proverb,
      that Love is blind, is perfectly true; they can see no imperfection in the
      mind or body of those dear to them. There are others in whom the strongest
      affections do not destroy clearness of vision, who see their friends on
      all sides, and perceive their faults and foibles, without loving them the
      less.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia Kendal was a person of the latter description. It might almost be
      called her temptation, that her mind beheld all that came before it in a
      clear, and a humorous light, such as only a disposition overflowing with
      warm affection and with the energy of kindness, could have prevented from
      bordering upon censoriousness. She had imagination, but it was not such as
      to make an illusion of the present, or to interfere with her almost
      satirical good sense. Happily, religion and its earthly manifestation&mdash;charity
      regulated her, taught her to fear to judge lest she should be judged,
      strengthened her naturally fond affections, and tempered the keenness that
      disappointment might soon have turned to sourness. The tongue, the temper,
      and the judgment knew their own tendencies, and a guard was set over them;
      and if the sentinel were ever torpid or deceived, repentance paid the
      penalty.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had not long seen her husband at home before she had involuntarily
      completed her view of his character. Nature must have designed him for a
      fellow of a college, where, apart from all cares, he might have collected
      fragments of forgotten authors, and immortalized his name by some edition
      of a Greek Lyric poet, known by four poems and a half, and two-thirds of a
      line quoted somewhere else. In such a controversy, lightened by
      perpetually polished poems, by a fair amount of modern literature, select
      college friendships, and methodical habits, Edmund Kendal would have been
      in his congenial element, lived and died, and had his portrait hung up as
      one of the glories of his college.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he had been carried off from school, before he had done more than
      prove his unusual capacity. All his connexions were Indian, and his
      father, who had not seen him since his earliest childhood, offered him no
      choice but an appointment in the civil service. He had one stimulus; he
      had seen Lucy Meadows in the radiant glory of girlish beauty, and had
      fastened on her all a poet&rsquo;s dreams, deepening and becoming more fervid in
      the recesses of a reserved heart, which did not easily admit new
      sensations. That stimulus carried him out cheerfully to India, and
      quickened his abilities, so that he exerted himself sufficiently to obtain
      a lucrative situation early in life. He married, and his household must
      have been on the German system, all the learning on one side, all the
      domestic cares on the other. The understanding and refinement wanting in
      his wife, he believed to be wanting in all women. As resident at a small
      remote native court in India, he saw no female society such as could
      undeceive him; and subsequently his Bayford life had not raised his
      standard of womankind. A perfect gentleman, his superiority was his own
      work, rather than that of station or education, and so he had never missed
      intercourse with really ladylike or cultivated, female minds, expected
      little from wife, or daughters, or neighbours; had a few learned friends,
      but lived within himself. He had acquired a competence too soon, and had
      the great misfortune of property without duties to present themselves
      obviously. He had nothing to do but to indulge his naturally indolent
      scholarly tastes, which, directed as they had been to Eastern languages,
      had even less chance of sympathy among his neighbours than if they had
      been classical. Always reserved, and seldom or never meeting with persons
      who could converse with him, he had lapsed into secluded habits, and
      learnt to shut himself up in his study and exclude every one, that he
      might have at least a refuge from the gossip and petty cares that reigned
      everywhere else. So seldom was anything said worth his attention, that he
      never listened to what was passing, and had learnt to say &lsquo;very well&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll
      see about it,&rsquo; without even knowing what was said to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But though his wife had been no companion, the illusion had never died
      away, he had always loved her devotedly, and her loss had shattered all
      his present rest and comfort; as entirely as the death of his son had
      taken from him hope and companionship.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a home it must have been, with Lucy reigning over it in her pert
      self-sufficiency, Gilbert and Sophy running riot and squabbling, and Maria
      Meadows coming in on them with her well-meant worries and persecutions!
    </p>
    <p>
      When taken away from the scene of his troubles, his spirits revived;
      afraid to encounter his own household alone, he had thought Albinia the
      cure for everything. But at home, habit and association had proved too
      strong for her presence&mdash;the grief, which he had tried to leave
      behind, had waited ready to meet him on the threshold, and the very sense
      that it was a melancholy welcome added to his depression, and made him
      less able to exert himself. The old sorrows haunted the walls of the
      house, and above all the study, and tarried not in seizing on their
      unresisting victim. Melancholy was in his nature, his indolence gave it
      force, and his habits were almost ineffaceable, and they were habits of
      quiet selfishness, formed by a resolute, though inert will, and fostered
      by an adoring wife. A youth spent in India had not given him ideas of
      responsibilities beyond his own family, and his principles, though sound,
      had not expanded the views of duty with which he had started in life.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a positive pleasure to Albinia to discover that there had been an
      inefficient clergyman at Bayford before Mr. Dusautoy, and to know that
      during half the time that the present vicar had held the living, Mr.
      Kendal had been absent, so that his influence had had no time to work. She
      began to understand her line of action. It must be her effort, in all
      loving patience and gentleness, to raise her husband&rsquo;s spirits and rouse
      his faculties; to make his powers available for the good of his
      fellow-creatures, to make him an active and happy man, and to draw him and
      his children together. This was truly a task to make her heart throb high
      with hope and energy. Strong and brave was that young heart, and not
      self-confident&mdash;the difficulty made her only the more hopeful,
      because she saw it was her duty. She was secure of her influence with him.
      If he did exclude her from his study, he left her supreme elsewhere, and
      though she would have given the world that their sovereignty might be a
      joint one <i>everywhere</i>, still she allowed much for the morbid
      inveterate habit of dreading disturbance. When he began by silence and not
      listening, she could always rouse him, and give him animation, and he was
      so much surprised and pleased whenever she entered into any of his
      pursuits, that she had full hope of drawing him out.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day when the fog, instead of clearing off had turned to violent rain,
      Albinia had been out on parish work, and afterwards enlivening old Mrs.
      Meadows by dutifully spending an hour with her, while Maria was nursing a
      nervous headache&mdash;she had been subject to headaches ever since...an
      ominous sigh supplied the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      But all the effect of Albinia&rsquo;s bright kindness was undone, when the
      grandmother learnt that Gilbert was gone to his tutor, and would have to
      come home in the rain, and she gave such an account of his exceeding
      delicacy, that Albinia became alarmed, and set off at once that she might
      consult his father about sending for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her opening of the hall door was answered by Mr. Kendal emerging from his
      study. He was looking restless and anxious, came to meet her, and
      uncloaked her, while he affectionately scolded her for being so
      venturesome. She told him where she had been, and he smiled, saying, &lsquo;You
      are a busy spirit! But you must not be too imprudent.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, nothing hurts me. It is poor Gilbert that I am anxious about.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So am I. Gilbert has not a constitution fit for exposure. I wish he were
      come home.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Could we not send for him? Suppose we sent a fly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He was consenting with a pleased smile, when the door opened, and there
      stood the dripping Gilbert, completely wet through, pale and chilled, with
      his hair plastered down, and his coat stuck all over with the horse&rsquo;s
      short hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You must go to bed at once, Gilbert,&rsquo; said his father. &lsquo;Are you cold?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very. It was such a horrid driving wind, and I rode so fast,&rsquo; said
      Gilbert; violently shivering, as they helped to pull him out of his great
      coat; he put his hand to his mouth, and said that his face ached. Mr.
      Kendal was very anxious, and Albinia hurried the boy up to bed, and
      meantime ordered quickly a basin of the soup preparing for dinner, warmed
      some worsted socks at the fire, and ran upstairs with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to have no substance in him; he had hardly had energy to undress
      himself, and she found him with his face hidden on the pillow, shivering
      audibly, and actually crying. She was aghast.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boys with whom she had been brought up, would never have given way so
      entirely without resistance; but between laughing, cheering, scolding,
      covering him up close, and rubbing his hands with her own, she comforted
      him, so that he could be grateful and cheerful when his father himself
      came up with the soup. Albinia noticed a sort of shudder pass over Mr.
      Kendal as he entered, and he stood close by Gilbert, turning his back on
      everything else, while he watched the boy eat the soup, as if restored by
      every spoonful. &lsquo;That was a good thought,&rsquo; was his comment to his wife,
      and the look of gratitude brought a flush of pleasure into her cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of all the dinners, this was the most pleasant; he was more gentle and
      affectionate, and she made him tell her about the Persian poets, and
      promise to show her some specimens of the Rose Garden of Saadi&mdash;she
      had never before been so near having his pursuits opened to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a favourite Gilbert is!&rsquo; Lucy said to Sophia, as Albinia lighted a
      candle and went up to his room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He makes such a fuss,&rsquo; said Sophy. &lsquo;What is there in being wet through to
      cry about?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia heard a little shuffle as she opened the door, and Gilbert pushed
      a book under his pillow. She asked him what he had been reading. &lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; he
      said, &lsquo;he had not been doing it long, for the flickering of the candle
      hurt his eyes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, you had better not,&rsquo; said Albinia, moving the flaring light to a
      less draughty part of the dingy whitewashed attic. &lsquo;Or shall I read to
      you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you come to stay with me?&rsquo; cried the boy, raising himself up to look
      after her, as she moved about the room and stood looking from the window
      over the trees at the water meadows, now flooded into a lake, and lighted
      by the beams of a young moon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can stay till your father is ready for tea,&rsquo; said Albinia, coming
      nearer. &lsquo;Let me see whether your hands are hot.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She found her own hand suddenly clasped, and pressed to his lips, and
      then, as if ashamed, he turned his face away; nor would she betray her
      pleasure in it, but merely said, &lsquo;Shall I go on with your book!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said he, wearily turning his reddened cheek to the other side. &lsquo;I
      only took it because it is so horrid lying here thinking.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am very sorry to hear it. Do you know, Gibbie, that it is said there is
      nothing more lamentable than for a man not to like to have his own
      thoughts for his company,&rsquo; said she, gaily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! but&mdash;!&rsquo; said Gilbert. &lsquo;If I lie here alone, I&rsquo;m always looking
      out there,&rsquo; and he pointed to the opposite recess. She looked, but saw
      nothing. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you know?&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Edmund?&rsquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He grasped her hands in both his own. &lsquo;Aye! Ned used to sleep there. I
      always look for him there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you mean that you would rather have another room? I would manage it
      directly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O no, thank you, I like it for some things. Take the candle&mdash;look by
      the shutter&mdash;cut out in the wood.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The boys&rsquo; scoring of &lsquo;E. &amp; G. K.,&rsquo; was visible there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Papa has taken all he could of Edmund&rsquo;s,&rsquo; said Gilbert, &lsquo;but he could not
      take that! No, I would not have any other room if you were to give me the
      best in the house.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am sure not! But, my dear, considering what Edmund was, surely they
      should be gentle, happy thoughts that the room should give you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He shuddered, and presently said, &lsquo;Do you know what?&rsquo; and paused; then
      continued, with an effort, getting tight hold of her hand, &lsquo;Just before
      Edmund died&mdash;he lay out there&mdash;I lay here&mdash;he sat up all
      white in bed, and he called out, clear and loud, &ldquo;Mamma, Gilbert&rdquo;&mdash;I
      saw him&mdash;and then&mdash;he was dead! And you know mamma did die&mdash;and
      I&rsquo;m sure I shall!&rsquo; He had worked himself into a trembling fit, hid his
      face and sobbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you have not died of the fever.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes&mdash;but I know it means that I shall die young! I am sure it does!
      It was a call! I heard Nurse say it was a call!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      What was to be done with such a superstition? Albinia did not think it
      would be right to argue it away. It might be in truth a warning to him to
      guard his ways&mdash;a voice from the twin-brother, to be with him through
      life. She knelt down by him, and kissed his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear Gilbert,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;we all shall die.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, but I shall die young.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And if you should. Those are happy who die young. How much pain your
      baby-brother and sisters have missed! How happy Edmund is now!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you really think it meant that I shall&rsquo;&rsquo; he cried, tremblingly. &lsquo;O
      don&rsquo;t! I can&rsquo;t die!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your brother called on what he loved best,&rsquo; said Albinia. &lsquo;It may mean
      nothing. Or rather, it may mean that your dear twin-brother is watching
      for you, I am sure he is, to have you with him, for what makes your mortal
      life, however long, seem as nothing. It was a call to you to be as pure on
      earth as he is in heaven. O Gilbert, how good you should be!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert did not know whether it frightened him or soothed him to see his
      superstition treated with respect&mdash;neither denied, nor reasoned away.
      But the ghastliness was not in the mere fear that death might not be far
      off.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pillow had turned a little on one side&mdash;Albinia tried to smooth
      it&mdash;the corner of a book peeped out. It was a translation of The
      Three Musqueteers, one of the worst and most fascinating of Dumas&rsquo; 
      romances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You wont tell papa!&rsquo; cried Gilbert, raising himself, in far more real and
      present terror than he had previously shown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How did you get it? Whose is it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is my own. I bought it at Richardson&rsquo;s. It is very funny. But you wont
      tell papa? I never was told not; indeed I was not.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, Gilbert dear, will you tell me a few things? I do only wish what is
      good for you. Why don&rsquo;t you wish that papa should hear of this book?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert writhed himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You know he would not like it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then why did you take to reading it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; cried the boy, &lsquo;if you only did know how stupid and how miserable it
      has been! More than half myself gone, and Sophy always glum, and Lucy
      always plaguing, and Aunt Maria always being a torment, you would not
      wonder at one&rsquo;s doing anything to forget it!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, but why do what you knew to be wrong?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nobody told me not.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Disobedience to the spirit, then, if not to the letter. It was not the
      way to be happier, my poor boy, nor nearer to your brother and mother.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Things didn&rsquo;t use to be stupid when Ned was there!&rsquo; sobbed Gilbert,
      bursting into a fresh flood of tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! Gilbert, I grieved most of all for <i>you</i> when first I heard your
      story, before I thought I should ever have anything to do with you,&rsquo; said
      Albinia, hanging over him fondly. &lsquo;I always thought it must be so forlorn
      to be a twin left solitary. But it is sadder still than I knew, if grief
      has made you put yourself farther from him instead of nearer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall be good again now that I have you,&rsquo; said Gilbert, as he looked up
      into that sweet face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you will begin by making a free confession to your father, and giving
      up the book.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t see what I have to confess. He would be so angry, and he never
      told me not. Oh! I cannot tell him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt that this was not the right way to begin a reformation, and yet
      she feared to press the point, knowing that the one was thought severe,
      the other timid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At least you will give up the book,&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O dear! if you would let me see whether d&rsquo;Artagnan got to England. I must
      know that! I&rsquo;m sure there can&rsquo;t be any harm in that. Do you know what it
      is about?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I do. My brother got it by some mistake among some French books. He
      read some of the droll unobjectionable parts to my sister and me, but the
      rest was so bad, that he threw it into the fire.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you think it funny?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To be sure I do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you remember the three duels all at once, and the three valets? Oh!
      what fun it is. But do let me see if d&rsquo;Artagnan got the diamonds.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, he did. But will this satisfy you, Gilbert? You know there are some
      exciting pleasures that we must turn our backs on resolutely. I think this
      book is one of them. Now you will let me take it? I will tell your father
      about it in private, and he cannot blame you. Then, if he will give his
      consent, whenever you can come home early, come to my dressing-room, out
      of your sisters&rsquo; way, and I will read to you the innocent part, so as to
      get the story out of your brain.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; said Gilbert, slowly. &lsquo;Yes, if you will not let papa be angry
      with me. And, oh dear! must you go?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think you had better dress yourself and come down to tea. There is
      nothing the matter with you now, is there?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He was delighted with the suggestion, and promised to come directly; and
      Albinia carried off her prize, exceedingly hopeful and puzzled, and
      wondering whether her compromise had been a right one, or a mere tampering
      with temptation&mdash;delighted with the confidence and affection bestowed
      on her so freely, but awe-struck by the impression which the boy had
      avowed, and marvelling how it should be treated, so as to render it a
      blessed and salutary restraint, rather than the dim superstitious terror
      that it was at present. At least there was hope of influencing him, his
      heart was affectionate, his will on the side of right, and in
      consideration of feeble health and timid character, she would overlook the
      fact that he had not made one voluntary open confession, and that the
      partial renunciation had been wrung from him as a choice of evils. She
      could only feel how much he was to be pitied, and how he responded to her
      affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was crossing the hall next day, when she heard a confusion of tongues
      through the open door of the dining-room, and above all, Gilbert&rsquo;s. &lsquo;Well,
      I say there are but two ladies in Bayford. One is Mrs. Kendal, and the
      other is Genevieve Durant!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A dancing-master&rsquo;s daughter!&rsquo; Lucy&rsquo;s scornful tone was unmistakeable, and
      so was the ensuing high-pitched querulous voice, &lsquo;Well, to be sure,
      Gilbert might be a little more&mdash;a little more civil. Not that I&rsquo;ve a
      word to say against&mdash;against your&mdash;your mamma. Oh, no!&mdash;glad
      to see&mdash;but Gilbert might be more civil.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think so indeed,&rsquo; said Albinia. &lsquo;Good morning, Miss Meadows. You see
      Gilbert has come home quite alive enough for mischief.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! I thought I might be excused. Mamma was so uneasy&mdash;though I know
      you don&rsquo;t admit visitors&mdash;my just coming to see&mdash;We&rsquo;ve been
      always so anxious about Gilbert. Gibbie dear, where is that flannel I gave
      you for your throat?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She advanced to put her finger within his neck-tie and feel for it.
      Gilbert stuck his chin down, and snapped with his teeth like a gin. Lucy
      exclaimed, &lsquo;Now, Gilbert, I know mamma will say that is wrong.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! we are used to Gilbert&rsquo;s tricks. Always bear with a boy&rsquo;s antics,&rsquo; 
      said Miss Meadows, preventing whatever she thought was coming out of Mrs.
      Kendal&rsquo;s month. Albinia took the unwise step of laughing, for her
      sympathies were decidedly with resistance both to flannels and to the
      insertion of that hooked finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Bowles has always said it was a case for great care. Flannel next the
      skin&mdash;no exposure,&rsquo; continued Miss Meadows, tartly. &lsquo;I am sure&mdash;I
      know I am the last person to wish to interfere&mdash;but so delicate&mdash;You&rsquo;ll
      excuse&mdash;but my mother was uneasy; and people who go out in all
      weathers&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope Mrs. Meadows had my note this morning.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O yes! I am perfectly aware. Thank you. Yes, I know the rule, but you&rsquo;ll
      excuse&mdash;My mother was still anxious&mdash;I know you exclude visitors
      in lesson-time. I&rsquo;m going. Only grandmamma would be glad&mdash;not that
      she wishes to interfere&mdash;but if Gilbert had on his piece of flannel&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you, Gilbert?&rsquo; said Albinia, becoming tormented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have been flannel all over all my life,&rsquo; said Gilbert, sulkily, &lsquo;one
      bit more or less can make no odds.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you have not that piece? said Albinia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, my dear! Think of that! New Saxony! I begged it of Mr. Holland. A new
      remnant&mdash;pink list, and all! I said it was just what I wanted for
      Master Gilbert. Mr. Holland is always a civil, feeling man. New Saxony&mdash;three
      shillings the yard&mdash;and trimmed with blue sarsenet! Where is it,
      Gilbert?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In a soup dish, with a crop of mustard and cress on it,&rsquo; said Gilbert,
      with a wicked wink at Albinia, who was unable to resist joining in the
      girls&rsquo; shout of laughing, but she became alarmed when she found that poor
      Miss Meadows was very near crying, and that her incoherency became so
      lachrymose as to be utterly incomprehensible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy, ashamed of her laughter, solemnly declared that it was very wrong of
      Gilbert, and she hoped he would not suffer from it, and Albinia, trying to
      become grave, judicial, and conciliatory, contrived to pronounce that it
      was very silly to leave anything off in an east wind, and hoping to put an
      end to the matter, asked Aunt Maria to sit down, and judge how they went
      on with their lessons.
    </p>
    <p>
      O no, she could not interrupt. Her mother would want her. She knew Mrs.
      Kendal never admitted visitors. She had no doubt she was quite right. She
      hoped it would be understood. She would not intrude. In fact, she could
      neither go nor stay. She would not resume her seat, nor let anything go
      on, and it was full twenty minutes before a series of little vibrating
      motions and fragmentary phrases had borne her out of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well!&rsquo; cried Gilbert, &lsquo;I hoped Aunt Maria had left off coming down upon
      us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O, mamma!&rsquo; exclaimed Lucy, &lsquo;you never sent your love to grandmamma.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Depend upon it she was waiting for that,&rsquo; said Gilbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      I&rsquo;m sure I wish I had known it,&rsquo; said Albinia, not in the most judicious
      manner. &lsquo;Half-past eleven!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aunt Maria says she can&rsquo;t think how you can find time for church when you
      can&rsquo;t see visitors in the morning,&rsquo; said Lucy. &lsquo;And oh! dear mamma,
      grandmamma says gravy soup was enough to throw Gilbert into a fever.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At any rate, it did not,&rsquo; said Albinia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! and, dear mamma, Mrs. Osborn is so hurt that you called on Mrs.
      Dusautoy before returning her visit; and Aunt Maria says if you don&rsquo;t call
      to-day you will never get over it, and she says that&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What business has Mrs. Osborn to ask whom I called on?&rsquo; exclaimed
      Albinia, impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because Mrs. Osborn is the leading lady in the town,&rsquo; said Lucy. &lsquo;She
      told Miss Goldsmith that she had no notion of not being respected.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And she can&rsquo;t bear the Dusautoys. She left off subscribing to anything
      when they came; and he behaved very ill to the Admiral and everybody at a
      vestry-meeting.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall ask your papa before I am in any hurry to call on the Osborns!&rsquo; 
      cried Albinia. &lsquo;I have no desire to be intimate with people who treat
      their clergyman in that way.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But Mrs. Osborn is quite the leader!&rsquo; exclaimed Lucy. They keep the best
      society here. So many families in the county come and call on them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very likely&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! Mrs. Osborn told Aunt Maria that as the Nugents called on you, and
      you had such connexions, she supposed you would be high. But you wont make
      me separate from Lizzie, will you? I suppose Miss Nugent is a fashionable
      young lady.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Miss Nugent is five years old. Don&rsquo;t let us have any more of this
      nonsense.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you wont part me from Lizzie Osborn,&rsquo; said Lucy, hanging her head
      pathetically on one side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall talk to your father. He said, the other day, he did not wish you
      to be so much with her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy melted into tears, and Albinia was conscious of having been first
      indiscreet and then sharp, hurt at the comments, feeling injured by Lucy&rsquo;s
      evident habit of reporting whatever she said, and at the failure of the
      attempt to please Mrs. Meadows. She was so uneasy about the Osborn
      question, that she waylaid Mr. Kendal on his return from riding, and laid
      it before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear Albinia,&rsquo; he said, as if he would fain have avoided the appeal,
      &lsquo;you must manage your own visiting affairs your own way. I do not wish to
      offend my neighbours, nor would I desire to be very intimate with any one.
      I suppose you must pay them ordinary civility, and you know what that
      amounts to. As to the leadership in society here, she is a noisy woman,
      full of pretension, and thus always arrogates the distinction to herself.
      Your claims will establish themselves.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, you don&rsquo;t imagine me thinking of that!&rsquo; cried Albinia, laughing. &lsquo;I
      meant their behaving ill to Mr. Dusautoy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know nothing about that. Mr. Dusautoy once called to ask for my support
      for a vestry meeting, but I make it a rule never to meddle with parish
      skirmishes. I believe there was a very unbecoming scene, and that Mr.
      Dusautoy was in the minority.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, Edmund, next time you&rsquo;ll see if a parson&rsquo;s sister can sit quietly by
      to see the parson beaten!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled, and moved towards his study.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then I am to be civil?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But is it necessary to call to-day?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should suppose not;&rsquo; and there he was, shut up in his den. Albinia went
      back, between laughing and vexation, and Lucy looked up from her exercise
      to say, &lsquo;Does papa say you must call on the Osborns?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was undignified! She bit her lip, and felt her false position, as with
      a quiver of the voice she replied, &lsquo;We shall make nothing but mischief if
      we talk now. Go on with your business.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The sharp, curious eyes did not take themselves off her face. She leant
      over Sophy, who was copying a house, told her the lines were slanting,
      took the pencil from her hand, and tried to correct them, but found
      herself making them over-black, and shaky. She had not seen such a line
      since the days of her childhood&rsquo;s ill-temper. She walked to the fireplace
      and said, &lsquo;I am going to call on Mrs. Osborn to-day. Not that your father
      desires it, but because I have been indulging in a wrong feeling.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure you needn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; cried Gilbert. &lsquo;It is very impertinent of Mrs.
      Osborn. Why, if he is an admiral, she was the daughter of an old
      lieutenant of the Marines, and you are General Sir Maurice Ferrars&rsquo; first
      cousin.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush, hush, Gilbert!&rsquo; said Albinia, blushing and distressed. &lsquo;Mrs.
      Osborn&rsquo;s standing in the place entitles her to all attention. I was
      thinking of nothing of the kind. It was because I gave way to a wrong
      feeling that I mean to go this afternoon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      On the Sunday, when Mr. and Mrs. Kendal went to pay their weekly visit to
      Mrs. Meadows, they found the old lady taking a turn in the garden. And as
      they were passing by the screen of laurels, Gilbert&rsquo;s voice was heard very
      loud, &lsquo;That&rsquo;s too bad, Lucy! Grandmamma, don&rsquo;t believe one word of it!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gilbert, you&mdash;you are, I&rsquo;m sure, very rude to your sister.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll not stand to hear false stories of Mrs. Kendal!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is all this?&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal, suddenly appearing, and discovering
      Gilbert pirouetting with indignation before Lucy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Meadows burst out with a shower of half sentences, grandmamma begged
      that no notice might be taken of the children&rsquo;s nonsense, Lucy put on an
      air of injured innocence, and Gilbert was beginning to speak, but his
      father put him aside, saying, &lsquo;Tell me what has happened, Sophia. From you
      I am certain of hearing the exact truth.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only,&rsquo; growled Sophy, in her hoarse boy&rsquo;s voice, &lsquo;Lucy said mamma said
      she would not call on Mrs. Osborn unless you ordered her, and when you
      did, she cried and flew into a tremendous passion.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sophy, what a story,&rsquo; exclaimed Lucy, but Gilbert was ready to
      corroborate his younger sister&rsquo;s report.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You know Lucy too well to attach any importance to her
      misrepresentations,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal, turning to Mrs. Meadows, &lsquo;but I know
      not what amends she can make for this most unprovoked slander. Speak,
      Lucy, have you no apology to make?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      For Lucy, in self-defence, had begun to cry, and her grandmother seemed
      much disposed to do the same. Miss Meadows had tears in her eyes, and
      incoherencies on her lips. The distress drove away all Albinia&rsquo;s
      inclination to laugh, and clasping her two hands over her husband&rsquo;s arm,
      she said, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t, Edmund, it is only a misunderstanding of what really
      happened. I did have a silly fit, you know, so it is my fault.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I cannot forgive for you as you do for yourself,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal, with a
      look that was precious to her, though it might have given a pang to the
      Meadowses. &lsquo;I did not imagine that my daughter could be so lost to the
      sense of your kindness and forbearance. Have you nothing to say, Lucy?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor child! she cannot speak,&rsquo; said her grandmother. &lsquo;You see she is very
      sorry, and Mrs. Kendal is too kind to wish to say any more about it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Go home at once, Lucy,&rsquo; said her father. &lsquo;Perhaps solitude may bring you
      to a better state of feeling. Go!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Direct resistance to Mr. Kendal was never thought of, and Lucy turned to
      go. Her aunt chose to accompany her, and though this was a decided relief
      to the company she left, it was not likely to be the best thing for the
      young lady herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kendal gave his arm to Mrs. Meadows, saying gravely that Lucy must not
      be encouraged in her habit of gossiping and inaccuracy. Mrs. Meadows quite
      agreed with him, it was a very bad habit for a girl, she was very sorry
      for it, she wished she could have attended to the dear children better,
      but she was sure dear Mrs. Kendal would make them everything desirable.
      She only hoped that she would remember their disadvantages, have patience,
      and not recollect this against poor Lucy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The warm indignation and championship of her husband and his son were what
      Albinia chiefly wished to recollect; but it was impossible to free herself
      from a sense of pain and injury in the knowledge that she lived with a spy
      who would exaggerate and colour every careless word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kendal returned to the subject as they walked home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope you will talk seriously to Lucy about her intolerable gossiping,&rsquo; 
      he said. &lsquo;There is no safety in mentioning any subject before her; and
      Maria Meadows makes her worse. Some stop must be put to it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should like to wait till next time,&rsquo; said Albinia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because this is too personal to myself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nay, your own candour is an example to which Lucy can hardly be
      insensible. Besides, it is a nuisance which must be abated.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia could not help thinking that he suffered from it as little as most
      people, and wondering whether it were this which had taught him silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      They met Miss Meadows at their own gate, and she told them that dear Lucy
      was very sorry, and she hoped they would take no more notice of a little
      nonsense that could do no one any harm; she would be more on her guard
      next time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kendal made no answer. Albinia ventured to ask him whether it would
      not be better to leave it, since her aunt had talked to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;Maria has no influence whatever with the children. She
      frets them by using too many words about everything. One quiet
      remonstrance from you would have far more effect.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia called the culprit and tried to reason with her. Lucy tried at
      first to battle it off by saying that she had made a mistake, and Aunt
      Maria had said that she should hear no more about it. &lsquo;But, my dear, I am
      afraid you must hear more. It is not that I am hurt, but your papa has
      desired me to talk to you. You would be frightened to hear what he says.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy chose to hear, and seemed somewhat struck, but she was sure that she
      meant no harm; and she had a great deal to say for herself, so voluble and
      so inconsequent, that argument was breath spent in vain; and Albinia was
      obliged to wind up, as an ultimatum, with warning her, that till she
      should prove herself trustworthy, nothing interesting would be talked of
      before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The atmosphere of gossip certainly had done its part in cultivating Mr.
      Kendal&rsquo;s talent for silence. When Albinia had him all to herself, he was
      like another person, and the long drives to return visits in the country
      were thoroughly enjoyable. So, too, were the walks home from the dinner
      parties in the town, when the husband and wife lingered in the starlight
      or moonlight, and felt that the weary gaiety of the constrained evening
      was made up for.
    </p>
    <p>
      Great was the offence they gave by not taking out the carriage!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was disrespect to Bayford, and one of the airs of which Mrs. Kendal was
      accused. As granddaughter of a Baron, daughter of one General Officer and
      sister of another, and presented at Court, the Bayford ladies were
      prepared to consider her a fine lady, and when they found her peculiarly
      simple, were the more aggrieved, as if her contempt were ironically
      veiled. Her walks, her dress, her intercourse with the clergy, were all
      airs, and Lucy spared her none of the remarks. Albinia might say, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t
      tell me all Aunt Maria says,&rsquo; but it was impossible not to listen; and
      whether in mirth or vexation, she was sure to be harmed by what she heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet, except for the tale-bearing, Lucy was really giving less trouble
      than her sister, she was quick, observant, and obliging, and under
      Albinia&rsquo;s example, the more salient vulgarities of speech and manner were
      falling off. There had seldom been any collision, since it had become
      evident that Mrs. Kendal could and would hold her own; and that her
      address and air, even while criticised, were regarded as something
      superior, so that it was a distinction to belong to her. How many of poor
      Albinia&rsquo;a so-called airs should justly have been laid to Lucy&rsquo;s account?
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, Sophy would attend to a word from her father, where she
      had obstinately opposed her step-mother&rsquo;s wishes, making her obedience
      marked, as if for the very purpose of enforcing the contrast. It was a
      character that Albinia could not as yet fathom. In all occupations and
      amusements, Sophy followed the lead of her elder sister, and in her
      lessons, her sole object seemed to be to get things done with as little
      trouble as possible, and especially without setting her mind to work, and
      yet in the very effort to escape diligence or exertion, she sometimes
      showed signs of so much ability as to excite a longing desire to know of
      what she would be capable when once aroused and interested; but the surly,
      ungracious temper rendered this apparently impossible, and whatever
      Albinia attempted, was sure, as if for the very reason that it came from
      her, to be answered with a redoubling of the growl of that odd hoarse
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Lucy&rsquo;s birthday, there was an afternoon party of her young friends,
      including Miss Durant. Albinia, who, among the girlhood of Fairmead and
      its neighbourhood, had been so acceptable a playmate, that her marriage
      had caused the outcry that &lsquo;there would never be any fun again without
      Miss Ferrars,&rsquo; came out on the lawn with the girls, in hopes of setting
      them to enjoy themselves. But they looked at her almost suspiciously,
      retained their cold, stiff, company manners, and drew apart into giggling
      knots. She relieved them of her presence, and sitting by the window,
      watched Genevieve walking up and down alone, as if no one cared to join
      her. Presently Lucy and Lizzie Osborn spoke to her, and she went in.
      Albinia went to meet her in the hall; she coloured and said, &lsquo;She was only
      come to fetch Miss Osborn&rsquo;s cloak.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia saw her disposing it over Lizzie&rsquo;s shoulders, and then running in
      again. This time it was for Miss Louisa&rsquo;s cloak, and a third time for Miss
      Drury&rsquo;s shawl, which Albinia chose to take out herself, and encountering
      Sophia, said, &lsquo;Next time, you had better run on errands yourself instead
      of sending your guests.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy gave a black look, and she retreated, but presently the groups
      coalesced, and Maria Drury and Sophy ran out to call Genevieve into the
      midst. Albinia hoped they were going to play, but soon she beheld
      Genevieve trying to draw back, but evidently imprisoned, there was an echo
      of a laugh that she did not like; the younger girls were skipping up in
      the victim&rsquo;s face in a rude way; she hastily turned round as in
      indignation, one hand raised to her eyes, but it was instantly snatched
      down by Maria Drury, and the pitiless ring closed in. Albinia sprang to
      her feet, exclaiming aloud, &lsquo;They are teasing her!&rsquo; and rushed into the
      garden, hearing on her way, &lsquo;No, we wont let you go!&mdash;you shall tell
      us&mdash;you shall promise to show us&mdash;my papa is a magistrate, you
      know&mdash;he&rsquo;ll come and search&mdash;Jenny, you shall tell!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Come with me, Genevieve,&rsquo; said Albinia, standing in the midst of the
      tormentors, and launching a look of wrath around her, as she saw tears in
      the young girl&rsquo;s eyes, and taking her hand, found it trembling with
      agitation. Fondling it with both her own, she led Genevieve away, turning
      her back upon Lucy and her, &lsquo;We were only&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor girl shook more and more, and when they reached the shelter of
      the house, gave way to a tightened, oppressed sob, and at the first kind
      words a shower of tears followed, and she took Albinia&rsquo;s hand, and clasped
      it to her breast in a manner embarrassing to English feelings, though
      perfectly natural and sincere in her. &lsquo;Ah! si bonne! si bonne!
      pardonnes-moi, Madame!&rsquo; she exclaimed, sobbing, and probably not knowing
      that she was speaking French; &lsquo;but, oh, Madame, you will tell me! Is it
      true&mdash;can he?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can who? What do you mean, my dear?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Admiral,&rsquo; said Genevieve, looking about frightened, and sinking her
      voice to a whisper. &lsquo;Miss Louisa said so, that he could send and search&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Search for what, my dear?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For my poor little secret. Ah, Madame, assuredly I may tell you. It is
      but a French Bible, it belonged to my martyred ancestor, Francois Durant,
      who perished at the St. Barthelemi&mdash;it is stained with his blood&mdash;it
      has been handed on, from one to the other&mdash;it was all that Jacques
      Durant rescued when he fled from the Dragonnades&mdash;it was given to me
      by my own dear father on his death-bed, with a charge to keep it from my
      grandmother, and not to speak of it&mdash;but to guard it as my greatest
      treasure. And now&mdash;Oh, I am not disobeying him,&rsquo; cried Genevieve,
      with a fresh burst of tears. &lsquo;You can feel for me, Madame, you can counsel
      me. Can the magistrates come and search, unless I confess to those young
      ladies?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Most decidedly not,&rsquo; said Albinia. &lsquo;Set your mind at rest, my poor child;
      whoever threatened you played you a most base, cruel trick.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, do not be angry with them, Madame; no doubt they were in sport. They
      could not know how precious that treasure was to me, and they will say
      much in their gaiety of heart.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do not like such gaiety,&rsquo; said Albinia. &lsquo;What, they wished to make you
      confess your secret?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. They had learnt by some means that I keep one of my drawers locked,
      and they had figured to themselves that in it was some relic of my
      Huguenot ancestors. They thought it was some instrument of death, and they
      said that unless I would tell them the whole, the Admiral had the right of
      search, and, oh! it was foolish of me to believe them for a moment, but I
      only thought that the fright would, kill my grandmother. Oh, you were so
      good, Madame, I shall never forget; no, not to the end of my life, how you
      rescued me!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We did not bring you here to be teased,&rsquo; said Albinia, caressing her. &lsquo;I
      should like to ask your pardon for what they have made you undergo.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, Madame!&rsquo; said Genevieve, smiling, &lsquo;it is nothing. I am well used to
      the like, and I heed it little, except when it falls on such subjects as
      these.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She was easily drawn into telling the full history of her treasure, as she
      had learnt from her father&rsquo;s lips, the Huguenot shot down by the
      persecutors, and the son who had fled into the mountains and returned to
      bury the corpse, and take the prized, blood-stained Bible from the breast;
      the escapes and dangers of the two next generations; the few succeeding
      days of peace; and, finally, the Dragonnade, when the children had been
      snatched from the Durant family, and the father and mother had been driven
      at length to fly in utter destitution, and had made their way to England
      in a wretched, unprovisioned open boat. The child for whose sake they
      fled, was the only one rescued from the hands of these enemies, and the
      tradition of their sufferings had been handed on with the faithfully
      preserved relic, down to the slender girl, their sole descendant, and who
      in early childhood had drunk in the tale from the lips of her father. The
      child of the persecutors and of the persecuted, Genevieve Durant did
      indeed represent strangely the history of her ancestral country; and as
      Albinia said to her, surely it might be hoped that the faith in which she
      had been bred up, united what was true and sound in the religion of both
      Reformed and Romanist.
    </p>
    <p>
      The words made the brown cheek glow. &lsquo;Ah, Madame, did I not say I could
      talk with you? You, who do not think me a heretic, as my dear
      grandmother&rsquo;s friends do, and who yet can respect my grandmother&rsquo;s
      Church.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Assuredly little Genevieve was one of the most interesting and engaging
      persons that Albinia had ever met, and she listened earnestly to her
      artless history, and pretty enthusiasms, and the story which she could not
      tell without tears, of her father&rsquo;s care, when the reward of her good
      behaviour had been the reading one verse in the quaint black letter of the
      old French Bible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversation lasted till Gilbert made his appearance, and Albinia was
      glad to find that his greeting to Genevieve was cordial and affectionate,
      and free from all that was unpleasant in his sisters&rsquo; manner, and he
      joined himself to their company when Albinia proposed a walk along the
      broad causeway through the meadows. It was one of the pleasantest walks
      that she had taken at Bayford, with both her companions so bright and
      merry, and the scene around in all the beauty of spring. Gilbert, with the
      courtesy that Albinia&rsquo;s very presence had infused into him, gathered a
      pretty wild bouquet for each, and Albinia talked of cowslip-balls, and
      found that neither Gilbert nor Genevieve had ever seen one; then she
      pitied them, and owned that she did not know how to get through a spring
      without one; and Gilbert having of course a pocketful of string, a
      delicious ball was constructed, over which Genevieve went into an
      inexpressible ecstasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the evening, Gilbert devoted himself to Genevieve, though more than
      one of the others tried to attract him, playing off the follies of more
      advanced girlhood, to the vexation of Albinia, who could not bear to see
      him the centre of attention to silly girls, when he ought to have been
      finding his level among boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gilbert makes himself so ridiculous about Jenny Durant,&rsquo; said his
      sisters, when he insisted on escorting her home, and thus they brought on
      themselves Albinia&rsquo;s pent-up indignation at their usage of their guest.
      Lucy argued in unsatisfactory self-defence, but Sophy, when shown how
      ungenerous her conduct had been, crimsoned deeply, and though uttering no
      word of apology, wore a look that gave her step-mother for the first time
      a hope that her sullenness might not be so much from want of compunction,
      as from want of power to express it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh! for a consultation with her brother. But he and his wife were taking a
      holiday among their kindred in Ireland, and for once Albinia could have
      echoed the aunts&rsquo; lamentation that Winifred had so many relations!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Albinia needed patience to keep alive hope and energy, for a sore
      disappointment awaited her. Whatever had been her annoyances with the
      girls, she had always been on happy and comfortable terms with Gilbert, he
      had responded to her advances, accommodated himself to her wishes, adopted
      her tastes, and returned her affection. She had early perceived that his
      father and sisters looked on him as the naughty one of the family, but
      when she saw Lucy&rsquo;s fretting interference, and, Sophia&rsquo;s wrangling
      contempt, she did not wonder that an unjust degree of blame had often
      fallen to his share; and under her management, he scarcely ever gave cause
      for complaint. That he was evidently happier and better for her presence,
      was compensation for many a vexation; she loved him with all her heart,
      made fun with him, told legends of the freaks of her brother Maurice and
      cousin Fred, and grudged no trouble for his pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      As long as The Three Musqueteers lasted, he had come constantly to her
      dressing-room, and afterwards she promised to find other pleasant reading;
      but after such excitement, it was not easy to find anything that did not
      appear dry. As the daughter of a Peninsular man, she thought nothing so
      charming as the Subaltern, and Gilbert seemed to enjoy it; but by the time
      he had heard all her oral traditions of the war by way of notes, his
      attendance began to slacken; he stayed out later, and always brought
      excuses&mdash;Mr. Salsted had kept him, he had been with a fellow, or his
      pony had lost a shoe. Albinia did not care to question, the evenings were
      light and warm, and the one thing she desired for him was manly exercise:
      she thought it much better for him to be at play with his fellow-pupils,
      and she could not regret the gain of another hour to her hurried day.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning, however, Mr. Kendal called her, and his look was so grave and
      perturbed, that she hardly waited till the door was shut to ask in terror,
      what could be the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing to alarm you,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;It is only that I am vexed about
      Gilbert. I have reason to fear that he is deceiving us again; and I want
      you to help us to recollect on which days he should have been at Tremblam.
      My dear, do not look so pale!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      For Albinia had turned quite white at hearing that the boy, on whom she
      had fixed her warm affection, had been carrying on a course of falsehood;
      but a moment&rsquo;s hope restored her. &lsquo;I did keep him at home on Tuesday,&rsquo; she
      said, &lsquo;it was so very hot, and he had a headache. I thought I might. You
      told me not to send him on doubtful days.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope you may be able to make out that it is right,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal,
      &lsquo;but I am afraid that Mr. Salsted has too much cause of complaint. It is
      the old story!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And so indeed it proved, when Albinia heard what the tutor had come to
      say. The boy was seldom in time, often altogether missing, excusing
      himself by saying he was kept at home by fears of the weather; but Mr.
      Salsted was certain that his father could not know how he disposed of his
      time, namely, in a low style of sporting with young Tritton, the son of a
      rich farmer or half-gentleman, who was the pest of Mr. Salsted&rsquo;s parish.
      Ill-learnt, slurred-over lessons, with lame excuses, were nothing as
      compared with this, and the amount of petty deceit, subterfuge, and
      falsehood, was frightful, especially when Albinia recollected the tone of
      thought which the boy had seemed to be catching from her. Unused to
      duplicity, except from mere ignorant, unmanageable school-children, she
      was excessively shocked, and felt as if he must be utterly lost to all
      good, and had been acting a lie from first to last. After the conviction
      had broken on her, she hardly spoke, while Mr. Kendal was promising to
      talk to his son, threaten him with severe punishment, and keep a strict
      account of his comings and goings, to be compared weekly with Mr.
      Salsted&rsquo;s notes of his arrival. This settled, the tutor departed, and no
      sooner was he gone, than Albinia, hiding her face in her hands, shed tears
      of bitter grief and disappointment. &lsquo;My dearest,&rsquo; said her husband,
      fondly, &lsquo;you must not let my boy&rsquo;s doings grieve you in this manner. You
      have been doing your utmost for him, if any one could do him good, it
      would be you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O no, surely I must have made some dreadful mistake, to have promoted
      such faults.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I have long known him not to be trustworthy. It is an evil of long
      standing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Was it always so?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I cannot tell,&rsquo; said he, sitting down beside her, and shading his brow
      with one hand; &lsquo;I have only been aware of it since he has been left alone.
      When the twins were together, they were led by one soul of truth and
      generosity. What this poor fellow was separately no one could know, while
      he had his brother to guide and shield him. The first time I noticed the
      evil was when we were recovering. Gilbert and Sophia were left together,
      and in one of their quarrels injured some papers of mine. I was very weak,
      and had little power of self-control; I believe I terrified him too much.
      There was absolute falsehood, and the truth was only known by Sophia&rsquo;s
      coming forward and confessing the whole. It was ill managed. I was not
      equal to dealing with him, and whether the mischief began then or earlier,
      it has gone on ever since, breaking out every now and then. I had hoped
      that with your care&mdash;But oh! how different it would have been with
      his brother! Albinia, what would I not give that you had but seen <i>him!</i>
      Not a fault was there; not a moment&rsquo;s grief did he give us, till&mdash;O
      what an overthrow of hope!&rsquo; And he gave way to an excess of grief that
      quite appalled her, and made her feel herself powerless to comfort. She
      only ventured a few words of peace and hope; but the contrast between the
      brothers, was just then keen agony, and he could not help exclaiming how
      strange it was, that Edmund should be the one to be taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nay,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;was not he ripe for better things? May not poor Gilbert
      have been spared that longer life may train him to be like his brother?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He never will be like him,&rsquo; cried Mr. Kendal. &lsquo;No! no! The difference is
      evident in the very countenance and features.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Was he like you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They said so, but you could not gather an idea of him from me,&rsquo; said Mr.
      Kendal, smiling mournfully, as he met her gaze. &lsquo;It was the most beautiful
      countenance I ever saw, full of life and joy; and there were wonderful
      expressions in the eyes when he was thinking or listening. He used to read
      the Greek Testament with me every morning, and his questions and remarks
      rise up before me again. That text&mdash;You have seen it in church.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because I live, ye shall live also,&rsquo; Albinia repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. A little before his illness we came to that. He rested on it, as he
      used to do on anything that struck him, and asked me, &ldquo;whether it meant
      the life hereafter, or the life that is hidden here?&rdquo; We went over it with
      such comments as I could find, but his mind was not satisfied; and it must
      have gone on working on it, for one night, when I had been thinking him
      delirious, he called me, and the light shone out of those bright dark eyes
      of his as he said, joyfully, &ldquo;It is both, papa! It is hidden here, but it
      will shine out there,&rdquo; and as I did not catch his meaning, he repeated the
      Greek words.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear boy! Some day we shall be glad that the full life and glory came so
      soon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head, the parting was still too recent, and it was the first
      time he had been able to speak of his son. It was a great satisfaction to
      her that the reserve had once been broken; it seemed like compensation for
      the present trouble, though that was acutely felt, and not softened by the
      curious eyes and leading questions of the sisters, when she returned to
      give what attention she could to their interrupted lessons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert returned, unsuspicious of the storm, till his father&rsquo;s stern
      gravity, and her depressed, pre-occupied manner, excited his attention,
      and he asked her anxiously whether anything were the matter. A sad gesture
      replied, and perhaps revealed the state of the case, for he became
      absolutely silent. Albinia left them together. She watched anxiously, and
      hurried after Mr. Kendal into the study, where his manner showed her not
      to be unwelcome as the sharer of his trouble. &lsquo;I do not know what to do,&rsquo; 
      he said, dejectedly. &lsquo;I can make nothing of him. It is all prevarication
      and sulkiness! I do not think he felt one word that I said.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;People often feel more than they show.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you go to him?&rsquo; he presently added. &lsquo;Perhaps I grew too angry at
      last, and I believe he loves you. At least, if he does not, he must be
      more unfeeling than I can think him. You do not dislike it, dearest.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O no, no! If I only knew what would be best for him!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He may be more unreserved with you,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal; and as he was
      anxious for her to make the attempt, she moved away, though in perplexity,
      and in the revulsion of feeling, with a sort of disgust towards the boy
      who had deceived her so long.
    </p>
    <p>
      She found him seated on a wheelbarrow by the pond, chucking pebbles into
      the still black water, and disturbing the duckweed on the surface. His
      colour was gone, and his face was dark and moody, and strove not to relax,
      as she said, &lsquo;O Gilbert, how could you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned sharply away, muttering, &lsquo;She is coming to bother, now!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It cut her to the heart. &lsquo;Gilbert!&rsquo; was all she could exclaim, but the
      tone of pain made him look at her, as if in spite of himself, and as he
      saw the tears he exclaimed in an impatient voice of rude consolation,
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to take so much to heart. No one thinks anything of it!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What would Edmund have thought?&rsquo; said Albinia; but the appeal came too
      soon, he made an angry gesture and said, &lsquo;He was nearly three years
      younger than I am now! He would not have been kept in these abominable
      leading-strings.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She was too much shocked to find an answer, and Gilbert went on, &lsquo;Watched
      and examined wherever I go&mdash;not a minute to myself&mdash;nothing but
      lessons at Tremblam, and bother at home; driven about hither and thither,
      and not allowed a friend of my own, nor to do one single thing! There&rsquo;s no
      standing it, and I won&rsquo;t!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am very sorry,&rsquo; said Albinia, struggling with choking tears. &lsquo;It has
      been my great wish to make things pleasant to you. I hope I have not
      teased or driven you to&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nonsense!&rsquo; exclaimed Gilbert, disrespectfully indeed, but from the bottom
      of his heart, and breaking at once into a flood of tears. &lsquo;You are the
      only creature that has been kind to me since I lost my mother and Ned, and
      now they have been and turned you against me too;&rsquo; and he sobbed
      violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean, Gilbert. If I stand in your mother&rsquo;s place, I
      can&rsquo;t be turned against you, any more than she could,&rsquo; and she stroked his
      brow, which she found so throbbing as to account for his paleness. &lsquo;You
      can grieve and hurt me, but you can&rsquo;t prevent me from feeling for you, nor
      for your dear father&rsquo;s grief.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He declared that people at home knew nothing about boys, and made an
      uproar about nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you call falsehood nothing?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Falsehood! A mere trifle now and then, when I am driven to it by being
      kept so strictly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know how to talk to you, Gilbert,&rsquo; said Albinia, rising; &lsquo;your
      conscience knows better than your tongue.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t go;&rsquo; and he went off into another paroxysm of crying, as he caught
      hold of her dress; and when he spoke again his mood was changed; he was
      very miserable, nobody cared for him, he did not know what to do; he
      wanted to do right, and to please her, but Archie Tritton would not let
      him alone; he wished he had never seen Archie Tritton. At last, walking up
      and down with him, she drew from him a full confidence, and began to
      understand how, when health and strength had come back to him in greater
      measure than he had ever before enjoyed, the craving for boyish sports had
      awakened, just after he had been deprived of his brother, and was debarred
      from almost every wholesome manner of gratifying it. To fall in with young
      Tritton was as great a misfortune as could well have befallen a boy, with
      a dreary home, melancholy, reserved father, and wearisome aunt. Tritton
      was a youth of seventeen, who had newly finished his education at an
      inferior commercial school, and lived on his father&rsquo;s farm, giving himself
      the airs of a sporting character, and fast hurrying into dissipation.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was really good-natured, and Gilbert dwelt on his kindness with warmth
      and gratitude, and on his prowess in all sporting accomplishments with a
      perfect effervescence of admiration. He evidently patronized Gilbert,
      partly from good-natured pity, and partly as flattered by the adherence of
      a boy of a grade above him; and Gilbert was proud of the notice of one who
      seemed to him a man, and an adept in all athletic games. It was a
      dangerous intimacy, and her heart sank as she found that the pleasures to
      which he had been introducing Gilbert, were not merely the free exercise,
      the rabbit-shooting and rat-hunting of the farm, nor even the village
      cricket-match, all of which, in other company, would have had her full
      sympathy. But there had been such low and cruel sports that she turned her
      head away sickened at the notion of any one dear to her having been
      engaged in such amusements, and when Gilbert in excuse said that every one
      did it, she answered indignantly, &lsquo;My brothers never!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is no use talking about what swells do that hunt and shoot and go to
      school,&rsquo; answered Gilbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you wish you went to school?&rsquo; asked Albinia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish I was out of it all!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He was in a very different frame. He owned that he knew how wrong it had
      been to deceive, but he seemed to look upon it as a sort of fate; he
      wished he could help it, but could not, he was so much afraid of his
      father that he did not know what he said; Archie Tritton said no one could
      get on without.&mdash;There was an utter bewilderment in his notions, here
      and there showing a better tone, but obscured by the fancies imbibed from
      his companion, that the knowledge and practice of evil were manly. At one
      moment he cried bitterly, and declared that he was wretched; at another he
      defended each particular case with all his might, changing and slipping
      away so that she did not know where to take him. However, the conclusion
      was far more in pity than anger, and after receiving many promises that if
      she would shield him from his father and bear with him, he would abstain
      from all she disapproved, she caressed and soothed the aching head, and
      returned to his father hopeful and encouraged, certain that the evil had
      been chiefly caused by weakness and neglect and believing that here was a
      beginning of repentance. Since there was sorrow and confession, there
      surely must be reformation.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a week Gilbert went on steadily, but at the end of that time his
      arrivals at home became irregular, and one day there was another great
      aberration. On a doubtful day, when it had been decided that he might go
      safely between the showers, he never came to Tremblam at all, and Mr.
      Salsted sent a note to Mr. Kendal to let him know that his son had been at
      the races&mdash;village races, managed by the sporting farmers of the
      neighbourhood. There was a sense of despair, and again a talk, bringing at
      once those ever-ready tears and protestations, sorrow genuine, but
      fruitless. &lsquo;It was all Archie&rsquo;s fault, he had overtaken him, persuaded him
      that Mr. Salsted would not expect him, promised him that he should see the
      celebrated &lsquo;Blunderbuss,&rsquo; Sam Shepherd&rsquo;s horse, that won the race last
      year. Gilbert had gone &lsquo;because he could not help it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not help it!&rsquo; cried Albinia, looking at him with her clear indignant
      eyes. &lsquo;How can you be such a poor creature, Gilbert?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is very hard!&rsquo; exclaimed Gilbert; &lsquo;I must go past Robble&rsquo;s Leigh twice
      every day of my life, and Archie will come out and be at me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is the very temptation you have to resist,&rsquo; said Albinia. &lsquo;Fight
      against it, pray against it, resolve against it; ride fast, and don&rsquo;t
      linger and look after him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked desponding and miserable. If she could only have put a spirit
      into him!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shall I walk and meet you sometimes before you get to Robbie&rsquo;s Leigh!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His face cleared up, but the cloud returned in a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is it?&rsquo; she asked. &lsquo;Only tell me. You know I wish for nothing so
      much as to help you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He did confess that there was nothing he should like better, if Archie
      would not be all the worse another time, whenever he should catch him
      alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But surely, Gilbert, he is not always lying in ambush for you, like a cat
      for a mouse. You can&rsquo;t be his sole game.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, but he is coming or going, or out with his gun, and he will often
      come part of the way with me, and he is such a droll fellow!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia thought that there was but one cure. To leave Gilbert daily
      exposed to the temptation must be wrong, and she laid the case before Mr.
      Kendal with so much earnestness, that he allowed that it would be better
      to send the boy from home; and in the meantime, Albinia obtained that Mr.
      Kendal should ride some way on the Tremblam road with his son in the
      morning, so as to convoy him out of reach of the tempter; whilst she tried
      to meet him in the afternoon, and managed so that he should be seldom
      without the hope of meeting her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia&rsquo;s likings had taken a current absolutely contrary to all her
      preconceived notions; Sophia, with her sullen truth, was respected, but it
      was not easy to like her even as well as Lucy, who, though pert and empty,
      had much good-nature and good-temper, and was not indocile; while Gilbert,
      in spite of a weak, shallow character, habits of deception, and low
      ungentlemanly tastes, had won her affection, and occupied the chief of her
      time and thoughts; and she dreaded the moment of parting with him, as
      removing the most available and agreeable of her young companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      That moment of parting, though acknowledged to be expedient, did not
      approach. Gilbert, could not be sent to a public school without risk and
      anxiety which his father did not like, and which would have been horror to
      his grandmother; and Albinia herself did not feel certain that he was fit
      for it, nor that it was her part to enforce it. She wrote to her brother,
      and found that he likewise thought a tutor would be a safe alternative;
      but then he must be a perfect man in a perfect climate, and Mr. Kendal was
      not the man to make researches. Mr. Dusautoy mentioned one clergyman who
      took pupils, Maurice Ferrars another, but there was something against
      each. Mr. Kendal wrote four letters, and was undecided&mdash;a third was
      heard of, but the locality was doubtful, and the plan went off, because
      Mr. Kendal could not make up his mind to go thirty miles to see the place,
      and talk to a stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia found that her power did not extend beyond driving him from &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll
      see about it,&rsquo; to &lsquo;Yes, by all means.&rsquo; Action was a length to which he
      could not be brought. Mr. Nugent was very anxious that he should qualify
      as a magistrate since a sensible, highly-principled man was much wanted
      counterbalance Admiral Osborn&rsquo;s misdirected, restless activity and the
      lower parts of the town were in a dreadful state. Mrs. Nugent talked to
      Albinia, and she urged it in vain. To come out of his study, examine
      felons, contend with the Admiral, and to meet all the world at the quarter
      sessions, was abhorrent to him, and he silenced her almost with sternness.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was really hurt and vexed, and scarcely less so by a discovery that
      she made shortly after. The hot weather had made the houses beneath the
      hill more close and unwholesome than ever, Simkins&rsquo;s wife had fallen into
      a lingering illness, and Albinia, visiting her constantly, was painfully
      sensible of the dreadful atmosphere in which she lived, under the roof,
      with a window that would not open. She offered to have the house improved
      at her own expense, but was told that Mr. Pettilove would raise the rent
      if anything were laid out on it. She went about talking indignantly of Mr.
      Pettilove&rsquo;s cruelty and rapacity, and when Mr. Dusautoy hinted that
      Pettilove was only agent, she exclaimed that the owner was worse, since
      ignorance alone could be excused. Who was the wretch? Some one, no doubt,
      who never came near the place, and only thought of it as money.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fanny,&rsquo; said Mr. Dusautoy, &lsquo;I really think we ought to tell her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Mrs. Dusautoy, &lsquo;I think it would be better. The houses
      belonged to old Mr. Meadows.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, if they are Mrs. Meadows&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t wonder at anything.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I believe they are Gilbert Kendal&rsquo;s.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They were very kind; Mr. Dusautoy strode out at the window, and his wife
      would not look at Albinia during the minute&rsquo;s struggle to regain her
      composure, under the mortification that her husband should have let her
      rave so much and so long about what must be in his own power. Her only
      comfort was the hope that he had never heard what she said, and she knew
      that he so extremely disliked a conference with Pettilove, that he would
      consent to anything rather than have a discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was, for the first time in her life, out of spirits. Gilbert was
      always upon her mind; and the daily walk to meet him was a burthen,
      consuming a great deal of time, and becoming trying on hot summer
      afternoons, the more so as she seldom ventured to rest after it, lest
      dulness should drive Gilbert into mischief, or, if nothing worse, into
      quarrelling with Sophia. If she could not send him safely out fishing, she
      must be at hand to invent pleasures and occupations for him; and the worst
      of it was, that the girls grudged her attention to their brother, and were
      becoming jealous. They hated the walk to Robble&rsquo;s Leigh, and she knew that
      it was hard on them that their pleasure should be sacrificed, but it was
      all-important to preserve him from evil. She had wished to keep the
      tutor-negotiations a secret, but they had oozed out, and she found that
      Mrs. and Miss Meadows had been declaring that they had known how it would
      be&mdash;whatever people said beforehand, it always came to the same thing
      in the end, and as to its being necessary, poor dear Gibbie was very
      different before the change at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia could not help shedding a few bitter tears. Why was she to be
      always misjudged, even when she meant the best? And, oh! how hard,
      well-nigh impossible, to forgive and candidly to believe that, in the old
      lady, at least, it was partiality, and not spite.
    </p>
    <p>
      In September, Mr. and Mrs. Ferrars returned from their journey. Albinia
      was anxious to see them, for if there was a sense that she had fallen
      short of her confident hopes of doing prosperously, there was also a great
      desire for their sympathy and advice. But Maurice had been too long away
      from his parish to be able to spare another day, and begged that the
      Kendals would come to Fairmead. Seeing that Albinia&rsquo;s heart was set on it,
      Mr. Kendal allowed himself to be stirred up to appoint a time for driving
      her over to spend a long day at Fairmead.
    </p>
    <p>
      For her own pleasure and ease of mind, Albinia made a point of taking
      Gilbert, and the girls were to spend the day with their grandmother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pretty old Fairmead!&rsquo; she cried, as the beech-trees rose before her; and
      she was turning round every minute to point out to Gilbert some of the
      spots of which she had told him, and nodding to the few scattered children
      who were not at school, and who looked up with mouths from ear to ear, and
      flushed cheeks, as they curtsied to &lsquo;Miss Ferrars.&rsquo; The &lsquo;Miss Ferrars&rsquo; 
      life seemed long ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      They came to the little green gate that led to what had been &lsquo;home&rsquo; for
      the happiest years of Albinia&rsquo;s life, and from the ivy porch there was a
      rush of little Willie and Mary, and close at hand their mamma, and Maurice
      emerging from the school. It was very joyous and natural. But there were
      two more figures, not youthful, but of decided style and air, and quiet
      but fashionable dress, and Albinia had only time to say quickly to her
      husband, &lsquo;my aunts,&rsquo; before she was fondly embraced.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not at all what she had intended. Mrs. Annesley and Miss Ferrars
      were very kind aunts, and she had much affection for them; but there was
      an end of the hope of the unreserve and confidence that she wanted. She
      could get plenty of compassion and plenty of advice, but her whole object
      would be to avoid these; and, besides, Mr. Kendal had not bargained for
      strangers. What would become of his opportunity of getting better
      acquainted with Maurice and Winifred, and of all the pleasures that she
      had promised Gilbert?
    </p>
    <p>
      At least, however, she was proud that her aunts should see what a
      fine-looking man her husband was, and they were evidently struck with his
      appearance and manner. Gilbert, too was in very good looks, and was
      altogether a bright, gentlemanly boy, well made, though with the air of
      growing too fast, and with something of uncertainty about his expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was quickly explained that the aunts had only decided, two days before,
      on coming to Fairmead at once, some other engagement having failed them,
      and they were delighted to find that they should meet their dear Albinia,
      and be introduced to Mr. Kendal. Setting off before the post came in,
      Albinia had missed Winifred&rsquo;s note to tell her of their arrival.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And,&rsquo; said Winifred, as she took Albinia upstairs, &lsquo;if I did suspect that
      would be the case, I wont say I regretted it. I did not wish to afford Mr.
      Kendal the pleasures of anticipation.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps it was better,&rsquo; said Albinia, smiling, &lsquo;especially as I suppose
      they will stay for the next six weeks, so that the days will be short
      before you will be free.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And now let me see you, my pretty one,&rsquo; said Winifred, fondly. &lsquo;Are you
      well, are you strong? No, don&rsquo;t wriggle your head away, I shall believe
      nothing but what I read for myself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t believe anything you read without the notes,&rsquo; said Albinia. &lsquo;I have
      a great deal to say to you, but I don&rsquo;t expect much opportunity thereof.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly not, for Miss Ferrars was knocking at the door. She had never
      been able to suppose that the sisters-in-law could be more to each other
      than she was to her own niece.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it became a regular specimen of a &lsquo;long day&rsquo; spent together by
      relations, who, intending to be very happy, make themselves very weary of
      each other, by discarding ordinary occupations, and reducing themselves to
      needlework and small talk. Albinia was bent on liveliness, and excelled
      herself in her droll observations; but to Winifred, who knew her so well,
      this brilliancy did not seem like perfect ease; it was more like effort
      than natural spirits. This was no wonder, for not only had the sight of
      new people thrown Mr. Kendal into a severe access of shyness and silence,
      but he was revolving in fear and dread the expediency of asking them to
      Willow Lawn, and considering whether Albinia and propriety could make the
      effort bearable. Silent he sat, while the aunts talked of their wishes
      that one nephew would marry, and that the other would not, and no one
      presumed to address him, except little Mary, who would keep trotting up to
      him, to make him drink out of her doll&rsquo;s tea-cups.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ferrars took pity on him, and took him and Gilbert out to call upon
      Colonel Bury; but this did not lessen his wife&rsquo;s difficulties, for there
      was a general expectation that she would proceed to confidences; whereas
      she would do nothing but praise the Dusautoys, ask after all the
      parishioners of Fairmead one by one, and consult about French
      reading-books and Italian grammars. Mrs. Annesley began a gentle warning
      against overtaxing her strength, and Miss Ferrars enforced it with such
      vehemence, that Winifred, who had been rather on that side, began to take
      Albinia&rsquo;s part, but perceived, with some anxiety, that her sister&rsquo;s
      attempts to laugh off the admonition almost amounted to an admission that
      she was working very hard. As to the step-daughters, no intelligence was
      attainable, except that Lucy would be pleased with a new crochet pattern,
      and that Sophy was like her father, but not so handsome.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next division of time passed better. Albinia walked out at the window
      to meet the gentlemen when they came home, and materially relieved Mr.
      Kendal&rsquo;s mind by saying to him, &lsquo;The aunts are settled in here till they
      go to Knutsford. I hope you don&rsquo;t think&mdash;there is not the least
      occasion for asking them to stay with us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you sure you do not wish it?&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal, with great kindness,
      but an evident weight removed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Most certain!&rsquo; she exclaimed, with full sincerity; &lsquo;I am not at all ready
      for them. What should I do with them to entertain?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal, &lsquo;you must be the judge. If there be no
      necessity, I shall be glad to avoid unsettling our habits, and probably
      Bayford would hardly afford much enjoyment to your aunts.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia glanced in his face, and in that of her brother, with her own arch
      fun. It was the first time that day that Maurice had seen that peculiarly
      merry look, and he rejoiced, but he was not without fear that she was
      fostering Mr. Kendal&rsquo;s retiring habits more than was good for him. But it
      was not only on his account that she avoided the invitation, she by no
      means wished to show Bayford to her fastidious aunts, and felt as if to
      keep them satisfied and comfortable would be beyond her power.
    </p>
    <p>
      Set free from this dread, and his familiarity with his brother-in-law
      renewed, Mr. Kendal came out to great advantage at the early dinner. Miss
      Ferrars was well read and used to literary society, and she started
      subjects on which he was at home, and they discussed new books and
      criticised critics, so that his deep reading showed itself, and even a
      grave, quiet tone of satire, such as was seldom developed, except under
      the most favourable circumstances. He and Aunt Gertrude were evidently so
      well pleased with each other, that Albinia almost thought she had been
      precipitate in letting him off the visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert had, fortunately, a turn for small children, and submitted to be
      led about the garden by little Willie; and as far as moderate enjoyment
      went, the visit was not unsuccessful; but as for what Albinia came for, it
      was unattainable, except for one little space alone with her brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I meant to have asked a great deal,&rsquo; she said, sighing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you, want me, I would contrive to ride over,&rsquo; said Maurice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, it is not worth that. But, Maurice, what is to be done when one sees
      one&rsquo;s duty, and yet fails for ever for want of tact and temper! Ah, I know
      what you will say, and I often say it to myself, but whatever I propose, I
      always do either the wrong thing or in the wrong way!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You fall a hundred times a day, but are raised up again,&rsquo; said Maurice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Maurice, tell me one thing. Is it wrong to do, not the best, but only the
      best one can?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is the wrong common to us all,&rsquo; said Maurice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I used to believe in &ldquo;whatever is worth doing at all, is worth doing
      well.&rdquo; Now, I do everything ill, rather than do nothing at all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There are only two ways of avoiding that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And they are&mdash;?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Either doing nothing, or admiring all your own doings.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Which do you recommend?&rsquo; said Albinia, smiling, but not far from tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear,&rsquo; said Maurice, &lsquo;all I can dare to recommend, is patience and
      self-control. Don&rsquo;t fret and agitate yourself about what you can&rsquo;t do, but
      do your best to do calmly what you can. It will be made up, depend upon
      it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no time for more, but the sound counsel, the sympathy, and
      playfulness had done Albinia wonderful good, and she was almost glad there
      had been no more privacy, or her friends might have guessed that she had
      not quite found a counsellor at home.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Christmas holidays did indeed put an end to the walks to meet Gilbert,
      but only so as to make Albinia feel responsible for him all day long, and
      uneasy whenever he was not accounted for. She played chess with him, found
      books, and racked her brains to seek amusements for him; but knowing all
      the time that it was hopeless to expect a boy of fourteen to be satisfied
      with them. One or two boys of his age had come home for the holidays, and
      she tried to be relieved by being told that he was going out with Dick
      Wolfe or Harry Osborn, but it was not quite satisfactory, and she began to
      look fagged and unwell, and had lost so much of her playfulness, that even
      Mr. Kendal was alarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophia&rsquo;s birthday fell in the last week before Christmas, and it had
      always been the family custom to drink tea with Mrs. Meadows. Albinia made
      the engagement with a sense of virtuous resignation, though not feeling
      well enough for the infliction, but Mr. Kendal put a stop to all notion of
      her going. She expected to enjoy her quiet solitary evening, but the
      result was beyond her hopes, for as she was wishing Gilbert good-bye, she
      heard the click of the study lock, and in came Mr. Kendal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thought you were gone,&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No. I did not like to leave you alone for a whole evening.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      If it were only an excuse to himself for avoiding the Meadows&rsquo; party, it
      was too prettily done for the notion to occur to his wife, and never had
      she spent a happier evening. He was so unusually tender and unreserved, so
      desirous to make her comfortable, and, what was far more to her, growing
      into so much confidence, that it was even better than what she used last
      year to picture to herself as her future life with him. It even came to
      what he had probably never done for any one. She spoke of a beautiful old
      Latin hymn, which she had once read with her brother, and had never seen
      adequately translated, and he fetched a manuscript book, where, written
      out with unrivalled neatness, stood a translation of his own, made many
      years ago, full of scholarly polish. She ventured to ask leave to copy it.
      &lsquo;I will copy it for you,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;but it must be for yourself alone.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She was grateful for the concession, and happy in the promise. She begged
      to turn the page, and it was granted. There were other translations,
      chiefly from curious oriental sources, and there were about twenty
      original poems, elaborated in the same exquisite manner, and with a deep
      melancholy strain of thought, and power of beautiful description, that she
      thought finer and more touching than almost anything she had read.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And these are all locked up for ever. No one has seen them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So. When I was a young lad, my poor father put some lines of mine into a
      newspaper. That sufficed me,&rsquo; and he shut the clasped book as if repenting
      of having revealed the contents.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I was not thinking of anything you would dislike with regard to those
      verses. I don&rsquo;t like to let in the world on things precious, but (how
      could she venture so far!) I was thinking how many powers and talents are
      shut up in that study! and whether they might not have been meant for
      more. I beg your pardon if I ought not to say so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The time is past,&rsquo; he replied, without displeasure; &lsquo;my youth is gone,
      and with it the enterprise and hopefulness that can press forward,
      insensible to annoyance. You should have married a man with freshness and
      energy more responsive to your own.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, Edmund, that is a severe reproach for my impertinent speech.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You must not expect too much from me,&rsquo; he continued. &lsquo;I told you that I
      was a broken, grief-stricken man, and you were content to be my
      comforter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Would that I could be so!&rsquo; exclaimed Albinia, &lsquo;but to try faithfully, I
      must say what is on my mind. Dear Edmund, if you would only look out of
      your books, and see how much good you could do, here in your own sphere,
      how much the right wants strengthening, how much evil cries out to be
      repressed, how sadly your own poor suffer&mdash;oh! if you once began, you
      would be so much happier!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She trembled with earnestness, and with fear of her own audacity, but a
      resounding knock at the door prevented her from even discovering whether
      he were offended. He started away to secure his book, and the two girls
      came in. Albinia could hardly believe it late enough for their return, but
      they accounted for having come rather earlier by saying that Gilbert had
      been making himself so ridiculous when he had come at last, that
      grandmamma had sent him home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At last!&rsquo; said Albinia. &lsquo;He set off only ten minutes after you, as soon
      as he found that papa was not coming.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All I know,&rsquo; said Lucy, &lsquo;is, that he did not come till half-past nine,
      and said he had come from home.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And where can he be now?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gone to bed,&rsquo; growled Sophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what he has been doing,&rsquo; said Lucy, who since the suspicion
      of favouritism, had seemed to find especial pleasure in bringing forward
      her brother&rsquo;s faults; &lsquo;but he came in laughing like a plough-boy, and
      talking perfect nonsense. And when Aunt Maria spoke to him, he answered
      quite rudely, that he wasn&rsquo;t going to be questioned and called to order,
      he had enough of petticoat government at home.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Sophy, breaking in with ungracious reluctance, as if against
      her will conveying some comfort to her step-mother for the sake of truth,
      &lsquo;what he said was, that if he bore with petticoat government at home, it
      was because Mrs. Kendal was pretty and kind, and didn&rsquo;t torment him out of
      his life for nothing, and what he stood from her, he would not stand from
      any other woman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But, Sophy, I am sure he did say Mrs. Kendal knew what she was going to
      say, and said it, and it was worth hearing, and he laughed in Aunt Maria&rsquo;s
      face, and told her not to make so many bites at a cherry.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He must have been beside himself,&rsquo; said Albinia, in a bewilderment of
      consternation, but Mr. Kendal&rsquo;s return put a stop to all, for the sisters
      never told tales before him, and she would not bring the subject under his
      notice until she should be better informed. His suffering was too great,
      his wrath too stern, to be excited without serious cause; but she spent a
      wakeful, anxious night, revolving all imaginable evils into which the boy
      could have fallen, and perplexing herself what measures to take, feeling
      all the more grieved and bound to him by the preference that, even in this
      dreadful mood, he had expressed for her. She fell into a restless sleep in
      the morning, from which she wakened so late as to have no time to question
      Gilbert before breakfast. On coming down, she found that he had not made
      his appearance, and had sent word that he had a bad headache, and wanted
      no breakfast. His father, who had made a visit of inspection, said he
      thought it was passing off, smiling as he observed upon Mrs. Meadows&rsquo;s
      mince-pie suppers and home-made wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy said nothing, but glanced knowingly at her sister and at Albinia,
      from neither of whom did she get any response.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia did not dare to take any measures till Mr. Kendal had ridden out,
      and then she went up and knocked at Gilbert&rsquo;s door. He was better, he
      said, and was getting up, he would be down-stairs presently. She watched
      for him as he came down, looking still very pale and unwell. She took him
      into her room, made him sit by the fire, and get a little life and warmth
      into his chilled hands before she spoke. &lsquo;Yes, Gilbert, I don&rsquo;t wonder you
      cannot lift up your head while so much is on your mind.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert started and hid his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did you think I did not know, and was not grieved?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; he cried, peevishly, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure I have the most ill-natured pair of
      sisters in the world.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you meant to deceive us again, Gilbert.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He had relapsed into the old habit&mdash;as usual, a burst of tears and a
      declaration that no one was ever so badly off, and he did not know what to
      do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You <i>do</i> know perfectly well what to do, Gilbert. There is nothing
      for it but to tell me the whole meaning of this terrible affair, and I
      will see whether I can help you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was always the same round, a few words would always bring the
      confession, and that pitiful kind of helpless repentance, which had only
      too often given her hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert assured her that he had fully purposed following his sisters, but
      that on the way he had unluckily fallen in with Archie Tritton and a
      friend, who had driven in to hear a man from London singing comic songs at
      the King&rsquo;s Head, and they had persuaded him to come in. He had been uneasy
      and tried to get away, but the dread of being laughed at about his
      grandmother&rsquo;s tea had prevailed, and he had been supping on oysters and
      porter, and trying to believe himself a fast man, till Archie, who had
      assured him that he was himself going home in &lsquo;no time,&rsquo; had found it
      expedient to set off, and it had been agreed that he should put a bold
      face on it, and profess that he had never intended to do more than come
      and fetch his sisters home.
    </p>
    <p>
      That the porter had anything to do with his extraordinary manner to his
      grandmother and aunt, was so shocking a notion, and the very hint made him
      cry so bitterly, and protest so earnestly that he had only had one pint,
      which he did not like, and only drank because he was afraid of being
      teased, that Albinia was ready to believe that he had been so elevated by
      excitement as to forget himself, and continue the style of the company he
      had left. It was bad enough, and she felt almost overpowered by the
      contemplation of the lamentable weakness of the poor boy, of the
      consequences, and of what was incumbent on her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She leant back and considered a little while, then sighed heavily, and
      said, &lsquo;Gilbert, two things must be done. You must make an apology to your
      grandmother and aunt, and you must confess the whole to your father.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave a sort of howl, as if she were misusing his confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It must be,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;If you are really sorry, you will not shrink. I
      do not believe that it could fail to come to your father&rsquo;s knowledge, even
      if I did not know it was my duty to tell him, and how much better to
      confess it yourself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      For this, however, Gilbert seemed to have no force; he cried piteously,
      bewailed himself, vowed incoherently that he would never do so again, and
      if she had not pitied him so much, would have made her think him
      contemptible.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was inexorable as to having the whole told, though dreading the
      confession scarcely less than he did; and he finally made a virtue of
      necessity, and promised to tell, if only she would not desert him,
      declaring, with a fresh flood of tears, that he should never do wrong when
      she was by. Then came the apology. It was most necessary, and he owned
      that it would be much better to be able to tell his father that his
      grandmother had forgiven him; but he really had not nerve to set out
      alone, and Albinia, who had begun to dread having him out of sight,
      consented to go and protect him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shrank behind her, and she had to bear the flood of Maria&rsquo;s surprises
      and regrets, before she could succeed in saying that he was very sorry for
      yesterday&rsquo;s improper behaviour, and had come to ask pardon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grandmamma was placable; Gilbert&rsquo;s white face and red eyes were pleading
      enough, and she was distressed at Mrs. Kendal having come out, looking
      pale and tired. If she had been alone, the only danger would have been
      that the offence would be lost in petting; but Maria had been personally
      wounded, and the jealousy she already felt of the step-mother, had been
      excited to the utmost by Gilbert&rsquo;s foolish words. She was excessively
      grieved, and a great deal more angry with Mrs. Kendal than with Gilbert;
      and the want of justification for this feeling, together with her great
      excitement, distress, and embarrassment, made her attempts to be dry and
      dignified ludicrously abortive. She really seemed to have lost the power
      of knowing what she said. She was glad Mrs. Kendal could walk up this
      morning, since she could not come at night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was not my fault,&rsquo; said Albinia, earnestly; &lsquo;Mr. Kendal forbade me. I
      am sure I wish we had come.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The old lady would have said something kind about not reproaching herself,
      but Miss Meadows interposed with, &lsquo;It was very unlucky, to be sure&mdash;Mr.
      Kendal never failed them before, not that she would wish&mdash;but she had
      always understood that to let young people run about late in the evening
      by themselves&mdash;not that she meant anything, but it was very
      unfortunate&mdash;if she had only been aware&mdash;Betty should have come
      down to walk up with them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert could not forbear an ashamed smile of intense affront at this
      reproach to his manliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was exceedingly unfortunate,&rsquo; said Albinia, trying to repress her
      vexation; &lsquo;but Gilbert must learn to have resolution to guard himself. And
      now that he is come to ask your forgiveness, will you not grant it to
      him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, yes, yes, certainly, I forgive him from my heart. Yes, Gilbert, I do,
      only you must mind and beware&mdash;it is a very shocking thing&mdash;low
      company and all that&mdash;you&rsquo;ve made yourself look as ill&mdash;and if
      you knew what a cake Betty had made&mdash;almond and citron both&mdash;&ldquo;but
      it&rsquo;s for Master Gilbert,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t grudge&rdquo;&mdash;and then to
      think&mdash;oh, dear!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia tried to express for him some becoming sorrow at having
      disappointed so much kindness, but she brought Miss Meadows down on her
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, yes&mdash;she grudged nothing&mdash;but she never expected to meet
      with gratitude&mdash;she was quite prepared&mdash;&rsquo; and she swallowed and
      almost sobbed, &lsquo;there had been changes. She was ready to make every excuse&mdash;she
      was sure she had done her best&mdash;but she understood&mdash;she didn&rsquo;t
      want to be assured. It always happened so&mdash;she knew her homely ways
      were not what Mrs. Kendal had been used to&mdash;and she didn&rsquo;t wonder&mdash;she
      only hoped the dear children&mdash;&rsquo; and she was absolutely crying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear Maria,&rsquo; said her mother, soothingly, &lsquo;you have worked yourself
      into such a state, that you don&rsquo;t know what you are saying. You must not
      let Mrs. Kendal think that we don&rsquo;t know that she is leading the dear
      children to all that is right and kind towards as.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, no, I don&rsquo;t accuse any one. Only if they like to put me down under
      their feet and trample on me, they are welcome. That&rsquo;s all I have to say.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia was too much annoyed to be amused, and said, as she rose to take
      leave, &lsquo;I think it would be better for Gilbert, as well as for ourselves,
      if we were to say no more till some more cool and reasonable moment.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am as cool as possible,&rsquo; said Miss Meadows, convulsively clutching her
      hand; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not excited. Don&rsquo;t excite yourself, Mrs. Kendal&mdash;it is
      very bad for you. Tell her not, Mamma&mdash;oh! no, don&rsquo;t be excited&mdash;I
      mean nothing&mdash;I forgive poor dear Gibbie whatever little matters&mdash;I
      know there was excuse&mdash;boys with unsettled homes&mdash;but pray don&rsquo;t
      go and excite yourself&mdash;you see how cool I am&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And she pursued Albinia to the garden-gate, recommending her at every step
      not to be excited, for she was as cool as possible, trembling and
      stammering all the time, with flushed cheeks, and tears in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wonder who she thinks is excited?&rsquo; exclaimed Albinia, as they finally
      turned their backs on her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was hardly in human nature to help making the observation, but it was
      not prudent. Gilbert took licence to laugh, and say, &lsquo;Aunt Maria is beside
      herself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never heard anything so absurd or unjust!&rsquo; cried Albinia, too much
      irritated to remember anything but the sympathy of her auditor. &lsquo;If I am
      to be treated in this manner, I have done striving to please them. Due
      respect shall be shown, but as to intimacy and confidence&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m glad you see it so at last!&rsquo; cried Gilbert. &lsquo;Aunt Maria has been the
      plague of my life, and I&rsquo;m glad I told her a bit of my mind!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      What was Albinia&rsquo;s consternation! Her moment&rsquo;s petulance had undone her
      morning&rsquo;s work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gilbert,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;we are both speaking very wrongly. I especially, who
      ought to have helped you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Spite of all succeeding humility the outburst had been fatal, and argue
      and plead as she might, she could not restore the boy to anything like the
      half satisfactory state of penitence in which she had led him from home.
      The giving way to her worse nature had awakened his, and though he still
      allowed that she should prepare the way for his confession to his father,
      all real sense of his outrageous conduct towards his aunt was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Disheartened and worn out, Albinia did not feel equal even to going to
      take off her walking things, but sat down in the drawing-room on the sofa,
      and tried to silence the girls&rsquo; questions and chatter, by desiring Lucy to
      read aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      By-and-by Mr. Kendal was heard returning, and she rose to arrest him in
      the hall. Her looks began the story, for he exclaimed, &lsquo;My dear Albinia,
      what is the matter?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, Edmund, I have such things to tell you! I have been doing so wrong.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She was almost sobbing, and he spoke fondly. &lsquo;No, Albinia, I can hardly
      believe that. Something has vexed you, and you must take time to compose
      yourself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He led her up to her own room, tried to soothe her, and would not listen
      to a word till she should be calm. After lying still for a little while,
      she thought she had recovered, but the very word &lsquo;Gilbert&rsquo; brought such an
      expression of anxiety and sternness over his brow as overcame her again,
      and she could not speak without so much emotion that he silenced her; and
      finding that she could neither leave the subject, nor mention it without
      violent agitation, he said he would leave her for a little while, and
      perhaps she might sleep, and then be better able to speak to him. Still
      she held him, and begged that he would say nothing to Gilbert till he had
      heard her, and to pacify her he yielded, passed his promise, and quitted
      her with a kiss.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      There was a messenger at Fairmead Parsonage by sunrise the next morning,
      and by twelve o&rsquo;clock Mr. and Mrs. Ferrars were at Willow Lawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kendal&rsquo;s grave brow and depressed manner did not reassure Winifred as
      he met her in the hall, although his words were, &lsquo;I hope she is doing
      well.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He said no more, for the drawing-room door was moving to and fro, as if
      uneasy on the hinges, and as he made a step towards it, it disclosed a
      lady with black eyes and pinched features, whom he presented as &lsquo;Miss
      Meadows.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, now&mdash;I think&mdash;since more efficient&mdash;since I leave
      Mrs. Kendal to better&mdash;only pray tell her&mdash;my love and my
      mother&rsquo;s&mdash;if I could have been of any use&mdash;or shall I remain?&mdash;could
      I be of any service, Edmund?&mdash;I would not intrude when&mdash;but in
      the house&mdash;if I could be of any further use.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of none, thank you,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal, &lsquo;unless you would be kind enough to
      take home the girls.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, papa!&rsquo; cried Lucy, I&rsquo;ve got the keys. You wont be able to get on at
      all without me. Sophy may go, but I could not be spared.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let it be as you will,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal; &lsquo;I only desire quiet, and that
      you should not inconvenience Mrs. Ferrars.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will help me, will you not!&rsquo; said Winifred, smiling, though she did
      not augur well from this opening scene. &lsquo;May I go soon to Albinia?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Presently, I hope,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal, with an uneasy glance towards Miss
      Meadows, &lsquo;she has seen no one as yet, and she is so determined that you
      cannot come till after Christmas, that she does not expect you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Meadows began one of her tangled skeins of words, the most tangible
      of which was excitement; and Mr. Kendal, knowing by long experience that
      the only chance of a conclusion was to let her run herself down, held his
      tongue, and she finally departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he breathed more freely, and said he would go and prepare Albinia to
      see her sister, desiring Lucy to show Mrs. Ferrars to her room, and to
      take care not to talk upon the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, Lucy, who was in high glory, obeyed by walking upon creaking
      tip-toe, apparently borrowed from her aunt, and whispering at a wonderful
      rate about her eagerness to see dear, dear mamma, and the darling little
      brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spare room did not look expectant of guests, and felt still less so.
      It struck Winifred as very like the mouth of a well, and the paper showed
      patches of ancient damp. One maid was hastily laying the fire, the other
      shaking out the curtains, in the endeavour to render it habitable, and
      Lucy began saying, &lsquo;I must apologize. If papa had only given us notice
      that we were to have the pleasure of seeing you,&rsquo; and then she dashed at
      the maid in all the pleasure of authority. &lsquo;Eweretta, go and bring up Mrs.
      Ferrars&rsquo;s trunks directly, and some water, and some towels.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Winifred thought the greatest mercy to the hunted maid would be to
      withdraw as soon as she had hastily thrown off bonnet and cloak, and Lucy
      followed her into the passage, repeating that papa was so absent and
      forgetful, that it was very inconvenient in making arrangements. Whatever
      was ordinarily repressed in her, was repaying itself with interest in the
      pleasure of acting as mistress of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ferrars beheld Gilbert sitting listlessly on the deep window-seat at
      the end of the passage, resting his head on his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well!&rsquo; exclaimed Lucy, &lsquo;if he is not there still! He has hardly stirred
      since breakfast! Come and speak to Mrs. Ferrars, Gilbert. Or,&rsquo; and she
      simpered, &lsquo;shall it be Aunt Winifred?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As you please,&rsquo; said Mrs. Ferrars, advancing towards her old
      acquaintance, whom she would hardly have recognised, so different was the
      pale, downcast, slouching figure, from the bright, handsome lad she
      remembered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How cold your hand is!&rsquo; she exclaimed; &lsquo;you should not sit in this cold
      passage.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As I have been telling him all this morning,&rsquo; said Lucy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How is she?&rsquo; whispered the boy, rousing himself to look imploringly in
      Winifred&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your father seems satisfied about her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment a door at some distance was opened, and Gilbert seemed to
      thrill all over as for the moment ere it closed a baby&rsquo;s cry was heard. He
      turned his face away, and rested it on the window. &lsquo;My brother! my
      brother!&rsquo; he murmured, but at that moment his father turned the corner of
      the passage, saying that Albinia had heard their arrival, and was very
      eager to see her sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still Winifred could not leave the boy without saying, &lsquo;You can make
      Gilbert happy about her, can you not? He is waiting here, watching
      anxiously for news of her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gilbert himself best knows whether he has a right to be made happy,&rsquo; said
      Mr. Kendal, gravely. &lsquo;I promised to ask no questions till she is able to
      explain, but I much fear that he has been causing her great grief and
      distress.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He fixed his eyes on his son, and Winifred, in the belief that she was
      better out of their way, hurried to Albinia&rsquo;s room, and was seen very
      little all the rest of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was spared, however, to walk to church the next morning with her
      husband, Lucy showing them the way, and being quiet and agreeable when
      repressed by Mr. Ferrars&rsquo;s presence. After church, Mr. Dusautoy overtook
      them to inquire after Mrs. Kendal, and to make a kind proposal of
      exchanging Sunday duty. He undertook to drive the ponies home on the
      morrow, begged for credentials for the clerk, and messages for Willie and
      Mary, and seemed highly pleased with the prospect of the holiday, as he
      called it, only entreating that Mrs. Ferrars would be so kind as to look
      in on &lsquo;Fanny,&rsquo; if Mrs. Kendal could spare her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thought,&rsquo; said Winifred to her husband, &lsquo;that you would rather have
      exchanged a Sunday when Albinia is better able to enjoy you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That may yet be, but poor Kendal is so much depressed, that I do not like
      to leave him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have no patience with him!&rsquo; cried Winifred; &lsquo;he does not seem to take
      the slightest pleasure in his baby, and he will hardly let poor Albinia do
      so either! Do you know, Maurice, it is as bad as I ever feared it would
      be. No, don&rsquo;t stop me, I must have it out. I always said he had no
      business to victimize her, and I am sure of it now! I believe this gloom
      of his has broken down her own dear sunny spirits! There she is&mdash;so
      unlike herself&mdash;so anxious and fidgety about her baby&mdash;will
      hardly take any one&rsquo;s word for his being as healthy and stout a child as I
      ever saw! And then, every other moment, she is restless about that boy&mdash;always
      asking where he is, or what he is doing. I don&rsquo;t see how she is ever to
      get well, while it goes on in this way! Mr. Kendal told me that Gilbert
      had been worrying and distressing her; and as to those girls, the eldest
      of them is intolerable with her airs, and the youngest&mdash;I asked her
      if she liked babies, and she growled, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; Lucy said Gilbert was waiting
      in the passage for news of mamma, and she grunted, &ldquo;All sham!&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s
      the whole I have heard of her! He is bad enough in himself, but with such
      a train! My poor Albinia! If they are not the death of her, it will be
      lucky!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well done, Winifred!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But, Maurice,&rsquo; said his impetuous wife, in a curiously altered tone, &lsquo;are
      not you very unhappy about Albinia?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall leave you to find that out for me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you are not?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think Kendal thoroughly values and appreciates her, and is very
      uncomfortable without her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose so. People do miss a maid-of-all-work. I should not so much
      mind it, if she had been only <i>his</i> slave, but to be so to all those
      disagreeable children of his too! And with so little effect. Why can&rsquo;t he
      send them all to school?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Propose that to Albinia.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She did want the boy to go somewhere. I should not care where, so it were
      out of her way. What creatures they must be for her to have produced no
      more effect on them!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor Albinia! I am afraid it is a hard task: but these are still early
      days, and we see things at a disadvantage. We shall be able to judge
      whether there be really too great a strain on her spirits, and if so, I
      would talk to Kendal.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I wonder what is to come of that. It seems to me like what John Smith
      calls singing psalms to a dead horse.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;John Smith! I am glad you mentioned him; I shall desire Dusautoy to bring
      him here on Monday.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What! as poor Albinia would say, you can&rsquo;t exist a week without John
      Smith.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Even so. I want him to lay out a plan for draining the garden. That pond
      is intolerable. I suspect that all, yourself included, will become far
      more good-tempered in consequence.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A capital measure, but do you mean that Edmund Kendal is going to let you
      and John Smith drain his pond under his very nose, and never find it out?
      I did not imagine him quite come to that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not <i>quite</i>,&rsquo; said Maurice; &lsquo;it is with his free consent, and I
      believe he will be very glad to have it done without any trouble to
      himself. He said that Albinia <i>thought it damp</i>, and when I put a few
      sanatory facts before him, thanked me heartily, and seemed quite relieved.
      If they had only been in Sanscrit, they would have made the greater
      impression.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One comfort is, Maurice, that however provoking you are at first, you
      generally prove yourself reasonable at last, I am glad you are not Mr.
      Kendal.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! it will have a fine effect on you to spend your Christmas-day
      tete-a-tete with him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ferrars&rsquo;s views underwent various modifications, like all hasty yet
      candid judgments. She took Mr. Kendal into favour when she found him
      placidly submitting to Miss Meadows&rsquo;s showers of words, in order to
      prevent her gaining access to his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Maria Meadows is a very well-meaning person,&rsquo; he said afterwards; &lsquo;but I
      know of no worse infliction in a sick-room.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wonder,&rsquo; thought Winifred, &lsquo;whether he married to get rid of her. I
      should have thought it justifiable had it been any one but Albinia!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The call on Mrs. Dusautoy was consoling. It was delightful to find how
      Albinia was loved and valued at the vicarage. Mrs. Dusautoy began by
      sending her as a message, John&rsquo;s first exclamation on hearing of the
      event. &lsquo;Then she will never be of any more use.&rsquo; In fact, she said, it was
      much to him like having a curate disabled, and she believed he could only
      be consoled by the hopes of a pattern christening, and of a nursery for
      his school-girls; but there Winifred shook her head, Fairmead had a prior
      claim, and Albinia had long had her eye upon a scholar of her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I told John that she would! and he must bear it as he can,&rsquo; laughed Mrs.
      Dusautoy; and she went on more seriously to say that her gratitude was
      beyond expression, not merely for the actual help, though that was much,
      but for the sympathy, the first encouragement they had met among their
      richer parishioners, and she spoke of the refreshment of the mirthfulness
      and playful manner, so as to convince Winifred that they had neither died
      away nor been everywhere wasted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Winifred had no amenable patient. Weak and depressed as Albinia was, her
      restlessness and air of anxiety could not be appeased. There was a look of
      being constantly on the watch, and once, when her door was ajar, before
      Winifred was aware she exerted her voice to call Gilbert!
    </p>
    <p>
      Pushing the door just wide enough to enter, and treading almost
      noiselessly, he came forward, looking from side to side as with a sense of
      guilt. She stretched out her hand and smiled, and he obeyed the movement
      that asked him to bend and kiss her, but still durst not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let me have the baby,&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ferrars laid it beside her, and held aloof. Gilbert&rsquo;s eyes were fixed
      intently on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, Gilbert,&rsquo; Albinia said, &lsquo;I know what you will feel for him. He can&rsquo;t
      be what you once had&mdash;but oh, Gilbert, you will do all that an elder
      brother can to make him like Edmund!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert wrung her fingers, and ventured to stoop down to kiss the little
      red forehead. The tears were running down his cheeks, and he could not
      speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If your father might only say the same of him! that he never grieved
      him!&rsquo; said Albinia; &lsquo;but oh, Gilbert&mdash;example,&rsquo; and then, pausing and
      gazing searchingly in his face, &lsquo;You have not told papa.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; whispered Gilbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Winifred,&rsquo; said Albinia, &lsquo;would you be so kind as to ask papa to come?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Winifred was forced to obey, though feeling much to blame as Mr. Kendal
      rose with a sigh of uneasiness. Gilbert still stood with his hand clasped
      in Albinia&rsquo;s, and she held it while her weak voice made the full
      confession for him, and assured his father of his shame and sorrow. There
      needed no such assurance, his whole demeanour had been sorrow all these
      dreary days, and Mr. Kendal could not but forgive, though his eye spoke
      deep grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I could not refuse pardon thus asked,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Oh, Gilbert, that I
      could hope this were the beginning of a new course!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia looked from Gilbert to his little brother, and back again to
      Gilbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It <i>shall</i> be,&rsquo; she said, and Gilbert&rsquo;s resolution was perhaps the
      more sincere that he spoke no word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor boy,&rsquo; said Albinia, half to herself and half aloud, &lsquo;I think I feel
      more strong to love and to help him!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      That interview was a dangerous experiment, and she suffered for it. As her
      brother said, instead of having too little life, she had too much, and
      could not let herself rest; she had never cultivated the art of being
      still, and when she was weak, she could not be calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still the strength of her constitution staved off the nervous fever of her
      spirits, and though she was not at all a comfortable patient, she made a
      certain degree of progress, so that though it was not easy to call her
      better, she was not quite so ill, and grew less irrational in her
      solicitude, and more open to other ideas. &lsquo;Do you know, Winifred,&rsquo; she
      said one day, &lsquo;I have been thinking myself at Fairmead till I almost
      believed I heard John Smith&rsquo;s voice under the window.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Winifred was obliged to look out at the window to hide her smile. Maurice,
      who was standing on the lawn with the very John Smith, beckoned to her,
      and she went down to hear his plans. He was wanted at home the next day,
      and asked whether she thought he had better take Gilbert with him. &lsquo;It is
      the wisest thing that has been said yet!&rsquo; exclaimed she. &lsquo;Now I shall have
      a chance for Albinia!&rsquo; and accordingly, Mr. Kendal having given a gracious
      and grateful consent, Albinia was informed; but Winifred thought her
      almost perverse when a perturbed look came over her, and she said, &lsquo;It is
      very kind in Maurice, but I must speak to him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He was struck by the worn, restless expression of her features, so unlike
      the calm contented repose of a young mother, and when she spoke to him,
      her first word was of Gilbert. &lsquo;Maurice, it is so kind, I know you will
      make him happy&mdash;but oh! take care&mdash;he is so delicate&mdash;indeed,
      he is&mdash;don&rsquo;t let him get wet through.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Maurice promised, but Albinia resumed with minutiae of directions, ending
      with, &lsquo;Oh! if he should get hurt or into any mischief, what should we do?
      Pray, take care, Maurice, you are not used to such delicate boys.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear, I think you may rely on me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, but you will not be too strict with him&mdash;&rsquo; and more was
      following, when her brother said, &lsquo;I promise you to make him my special
      charge. I like the boy very much. I think you may be reasonable, and trust
      him with me, without so much agitation. You have not let me see my own
      nephew yet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia looked with her wistful piteous face at her brother as he took in
      his arms her noble-looking fair infant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are a great fellow indeed, sir,&rsquo; said his uncle. &lsquo;Now if I were your
      mamma, I would be proud of you, rather than&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am afraid!&rsquo; said Albinia, in a sudden low whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let me have him,&rsquo; she said; then as Maurice bent over her, and she
      hastily gathered the babe into her arms, she whispered in quick, low,
      faint accents, &lsquo;Do you know how many children have been born in this
      house?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ferrars understood her, he too had seen the catalogue in the church,
      and guessed that the phantoms of her boy&rsquo;s dead brethren dwelt on her
      imagination, forbidding her to rejoice in him hopefully. He tried to say
      something encouraging of the child&rsquo;s appearance, but she would not let him
      go on. &lsquo;I know,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;he is so now&mdash;but&mdash;&rsquo; then catching
      her breath again and speaking very low, &lsquo;his father does not dare look at
      him&mdash;I see that he is sorry for me&mdash;Oh, Maurice, it will come,
      and I shall be able to do nothing!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Maurice felt his lip quivering as his sister&rsquo;s voice became choked&mdash;the
      sister to whom he had once been the whole world, and who still could pour
      out her inmost heart more freely to him than to any other. But it was a
      time for grave authority, and though he spoke gently, it was almost
      sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Albinia, this is not right. It is not thankful or trustful. No, do not
      cry, but listen to me. Your child is as likely to do well as any child in
      the world, but nothing is so likely to do him harm as your want of
      composure.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I tell myself so,&rsquo; said Albinia, &lsquo;but there is no helping it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, there is. Make it your duty to keep yourself still, and not be
      troubled about what may or may not happen, but be glad of the present
      pleasure.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you think I am?&rsquo; said Albinia, half smiling; &lsquo;so glad, that I grow
      frightened at myself, and&mdash;&rsquo; As if fain to leave the subject, she
      added, &lsquo;And it is what you don&rsquo;t understand, Maurice, but he can&rsquo;t be the
      first to Edmund as he is to me&mdash;never&mdash;and when I get almost
      jealous for him, I think of Gilbert and the girls&mdash;and oh! there is
      so much to do for them&mdash;they want a mother so much&mdash;and Winifred
      wont let me see them, or tell me about them!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She had grown piteous and incoherent, and a glance from Winifred told him,
      &lsquo;this is always the way.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;you will never be fit to attend to them if you do not
      use this present time rightly. You may hurt your health, and still more
      certainly, you will go to work fretfully and impetuously. If you have a
      busy life, the more reason to learn to be tranquil. Calm is forced on you
      now, and if you give way to useless nervous brooding over the work you are
      obliged to lay aside for a time, you have no right to hope that you will
      either have judgment or temper for your tasks.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But how am I to keep from thinking, Maurice? The weaker I am, the more I
      think.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you dutiful as to what Winifred there thinks wisest? Ah! Albinia, you
      want to learn, as poor Queen Anne of Austria did, that docility in illness
      may be self-resignation into higher Hands. Perhaps you despise it, but it
      is no mean exercise of strength and resolution to be still.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia looked at him as if receiving a new idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And,&rsquo; he added, bending nearer her face, and speaking lower, &lsquo;when you
      pray, let them be hearty faithful prayers that God&rsquo;s hand may be over your
      child&mdash;your children, not half-hearted faithless ones, that He may
      work out your will in them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, Maurice, how did you know? But you are not going? I have so much to
      talk over with you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I must go; and you must be still. Indeed I will watch over Gilbert
      as though he were mine. Yes, even more. Don&rsquo;t speak again, Albinia, I
      desire you will not. Good-bye.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      That lecture had been the most wholesome treatment she had yet received;
      she ceased to give way without effort to restless thoughts and cares, and
      was much less refractory.
    </p>
    <p>
      When at last Lucy and Sophia were admitted, Winifred found perils that she
      had not anticipated. Lucy was indeed supremely and girlishly happy: but it
      was Sophy whose eye Albinia sought with anxiety, and that eye was averted.
      Her cheek was cold like that of a doll when Albinia touched it eagerly
      with her lips; and when Lucy admonished her to kiss the dear little
      brother, she fairly turned and ran out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor Sophy!&rsquo; said Lucy. &lsquo;Never mind her, mamma, but she is odder than
      ever, since baby has been born. When Eweretta came up and told us, she hid
      her face and cried; and when grandmamma wanted to make us promise to love
      him with all our hearts, and not make any difference, she would only say,
      &ldquo;I wont!&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We will leave him to take care of that, Lucy,&rsquo; said Albinia. But though
      she spoke cheerfully, Winifred was not surprised, after a little interval,
      to hear sounds like stifled weeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost every home subject was so dangerous, that whenever Mrs. Ferrars
      wanted to make cheerful, innocent conversation, she began to talk of her
      visit to Ireland and the beautiful Galway coast, and the O&rsquo;Mores of
      Ballymakilty, till Albinia grew quite sick of the names of the whole clan
      of thirty-six cousins, and thought, with her aunts, that Winifred was too
      Irish. Yet, at any other time, the histories would have made her sometimes
      laugh, and sometimes cry, but the world was sadly out of joint with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a sudden change when, for the first time her eye rested on the
      lawn, and she beheld the work of drainage. The light glanced in her eye,
      the colour rose on her cheek, and she exclaimed, &lsquo;How kind of Edmund!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Winifred must needs give her husband his share. &lsquo;Ah! you would never have
      had it done without Maurice.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Albinia, &lsquo;Edmund has been out of the way of such things, but
      he consented, you know.&rsquo; Then as her eyes grew liquid, &lsquo;A duck pond is a
      funny subject for sentiment, but oh! if you knew what that place has been
      to my imagination from the first, and how the wreaths of mist have wound
      themselves into spectres in my dreams, and stretched out white shrouds now
      for one, now for the other!&rsquo; and she shuddered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you have gone through all this and never spoken. No wonder your
      nerves and spirits were tried.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I did speak at first,&rsquo; said Albinia; &lsquo;but I thought Edmund did not hear,
      or thought it nonsense, and so did I at times. But you see he did attend;
      he always does, you see, at the right time. It was only my impatience.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suspect Maurice and John Smith had more to do with it,&rsquo; said Winifred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, we wont quarrel about that,&rsquo; said Albinia. &lsquo;I only know that
      whoever brought it about has taken the heaviest weight off my mind that
      has been there yet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In truth, the terror, half real, half imaginary, had been a sorer burthen
      than all the positive cares for those unruly children, or their silent,
      melancholy father; and the relief told in all ways&mdash;above all, in the
      peace with which she began to regard her child. Still she would provoke
      Winifred by bestowing all her gratitude on Mr. Kendal, who began to be
      persuaded that he had made an heroic exertion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Winifred had been somewhat scandalized by discovering Albinia&rsquo;s
      deficiencies in the furniture development. She was too active and
      stirring, and too fond of out-of-door occupation, to regard interior
      decoration as one of the domestic graces, &lsquo;her nest was rather that of the
      ostrich than the chaffinch,&rsquo; as Winifred told her on the discovery that
      her morning-room had been used for no other purpose than as a deposit for
      all the books, wedding presents, lumber, etc., which she had never had
      leisure to arrange.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You might be more civil,&rsquo; answered Albinia. &lsquo;Remember that the ringdove
      never made half such a fuss about her nest as the magpie.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I am glad you have found some likeness in yourself to a dove,&rsquo; 
      rejoined Winifred.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ferrars set vigorously to work with Lucy, and rendered the room so
      pretty and pleasant, that Lucy pronounced that it must be called nothing
      but the boudoir, for it was a perfect little bijou.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia was laid on the sofa by the sparkling fire, by her side the little
      cot, and in her hand a most happy affectionate letter from Gilbert,
      detailing the Fairmead Christmas festivities. She felt the invigoration of
      change of room, admired and was grateful for Winifred&rsquo;s work, and looked
      so fair and bright, so tranquil and so contented, that her sister and
      husband could not help pausing to contemplate her as an absolutely new
      creature in a state of quiescence.
    </p>
    <p>
      It did not last long, and Mrs. Ferrars felt herself the unwilling culprit.
      Attracted by sounds in the hall, she found the two girls receiving from
      the hands of Genevieve Durant a pretty basket choicely adorned with sprays
      of myrtle, saying mamma would be much obliged, and they would take it up
      at once; Genevieve should take home her basket, and down plunged their
      hands regardless of the garniture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Genevieve&rsquo;s disappointed look caught Winifred&rsquo;s attention, and springing
      forward she exclaimed, &lsquo;You shall come to Mrs. Kendal yourself, my dear.
      She must see your pretty basket,&rsquo; and yourself, she could have added, as
      she met the grateful glitter of the dark eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy remonstrated that mamma had seen no one yet, not even Aunt Maria, but
      Mrs. Ferrars would not listen, and treading airily, yet with reverence
      that would have befitted a royal palace, Genevieve was ushered upstairs,
      and with heartfelt sweetness, and timid grace, presented her etrennes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the fragrant sprays lay a small white-paper parcel, tied with narrow
      blue satin bows, such as no English fingers could accomplish, and within
      was a little frock-body, exquisitely embroidered, with a breastplate of
      actual point lace in a pattern like frostwork on the windows. It was such
      work as Madame Belmarche had learnt in a convent in times of history, and
      poor little Genevieve had almost worn out her black eyes on this piece of
      homage to her dear Mrs. Kendal, grieving only that she had not been able
      to add the length of robe needed to complete her gift.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia&rsquo;s kiss was recompense beyond her dreams, and she fairly cried for
      joy when she was told that she should come and help to dress the babe in
      it for his christening. Mrs. Ferrars would walk out with her at once to
      buy a sufficiency of cambric for the mighty skirts.
    </p>
    <p>
      That visit was indeed nothing but pleasure, but Mrs. Ferrars had not
      calculated on contingencies and family punctilios. She forgot that it
      would be a mortal offence to let in any one rather than Miss Meadows; but
      the rest of the family were so well aware of it, that when she returned
      she heard a perfect sparrow&rsquo;s-nest of voices&mdash;Lucy&rsquo;s pert and eager,
      Miss Meadows&rsquo;s injured and shrill, and Albinia&rsquo;s, alas! thin and loud,
      half sarcasm, half fret.
    </p>
    <p>
      There sat Aunt Maria fidgeting in the arm-chair; Lucy stood by the fire;
      Albinia&rsquo;s countenance sadly different from what it had been in the morning&mdash;weary,
      impatient, and excited, all that it ought not to be!
    </p>
    <p>
      Winifred would have cleared the room at once, but this was not easy, and
      poor Albinia was so far gone as to be determined on finishing that endless
      thing, an altercation, so all three began explaining and appealing at
      once.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed that Mrs. Osborn was requiting Mrs. Kendal&rsquo;s neglect in not
      having inquired after her when the Admiral&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s husband died, by the
      omission of inquiries at present; whereat Albinia laughed a feeble,
      overdone giggle, and observed that she believed Mrs. Osborn knew all that
      passed in Willow Lawn better than the inmates; and Lucy deposed that Sophy
      and Loo were together every day, though Sophy knew mamma did not like it.
      Miss Meadows said if reparation were not made, the Osborns had expressed
      their intention of omitting Lucy and Sophy from their Twelfth-day party.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this Albinia pettishly replied that the girls were to go to no
      Christmas parties without her; Miss Meadows had taken it very much to
      heart, and Lucy was declaiming against mamma making any condescension to
      Mrs. Osborn, or herself being supposed to care for &lsquo;the Osborn&rsquo;s parties,&rsquo; 
      where the boys were so rude and vulgar, the girls so boisterous, and the
      dancing a mere romp. Sophy might like it, but she never did!
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Meadows was hurt by her niece&rsquo;s defection, and had come to &lsquo;Oh, very
      well,&rsquo; and &lsquo;things were altered,&rsquo; and &lsquo;people used to be grateful to old
      friends, but there were changes.&rsquo; And thereby Lucy grew personal as to the
      manners of the Osborns, while Albinia defended herself against the being
      grand or exclusive, but it was her duty to do what she thought right for
      the children! Yes, Miss Meadows was quite aware&mdash;only grandmamma was
      so nervous about poor dear Gibbie missing his Christmas dinner for the
      first time&mdash;being absent&mdash;Mrs. Ferrars would take great care,
      but damp stockings and all&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Winifred endeavoured to stem the tide of words, but in vain, between the
      meandering incoherency of the one, and the nervous rapidity of the other,
      and they had both set off again on this fresh score, when in despair she
      ran downstairs, rapped at the study door, and cried, &lsquo;Mr. Kendal, Mr.
      Kendal, will you not come! I can&rsquo;t get Miss Meadows out of Albinia&rsquo;s
      room.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Forth came Mr. Kendal, walked straight upstairs, and stood in full majesty
      on the threshold. Holding out his hand to Maria with grave courtesy, he
      thanked her for coming to see his wife, but at the same time handed her
      down, saw her out safely at the hall door, and Lucy into the drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a pity that he had not returned to Albinia&rsquo;s room, for she was too
      much excited to be composed without authority. First, she scolded
      Winifred; &lsquo;it was the thing she most wished to avoid, that he should fancy
      her teased by anything the Meadowses could say,&rsquo; and she laughed, and
      protested she never was vexed, such absurdity did not hurt her in the
      least.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It has tired you, though,&rsquo; said Winifred. &lsquo;Lie quite down and sleep.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, however, Albinia would not believe that she was tired, and
      began to talk of the Osborns and their party&mdash;she was annoyed at the
      being thought too fine. &lsquo;If it were not such a penance, and if you would
      not be gone home, I really would ask you to take the girls, Winifred.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall not be gone home.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, you will. I am well, and every one wants you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did you not hear Willie&rsquo;s complimentary message, that he is never naughty
      now, because Gilbert makes him so happy?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But, Winifred, the penny club! The people must have their things.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They can wait, or&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is very well for us to talk of waiting,&rsquo; cried Albinia, &lsquo;but how
      should we like a frosty night without cloaks, or blankets, or fire? I did
      not think it of you, Winifred. It is the first winter I have been away
      from my poor old dames, and I did think you would have cared for them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And thereupon her overwrought spirits gave way in a flood of tears, as she
      angrily averted her face from her sister, who could have cried too, not at
      the injustice, but with compassion and perplexity lest there should be an
      equally violent reaction either of remorse or of mirth.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must be confessed that Albinia was very much the creature of health.
      Never having been ill before, the depression had been so new that it broke
      her completely down; convalescence made her fractious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recovery, however, filled her with such an ecstasy of animal spirits that
      her time seemed to be entirely passed in happiness or in sleep, and cares
      appeared to have lost all power. It was so sudden a change that Winifred
      was startled, though it was a very pleasant one, and she did not reflect
      that this was as far from the calm, self-restrained, meditative
      tranquillity enjoined by Maurice, as had been the previous restless,
      querulous state. Both were body more than mind, but Mrs. Ferrars was much
      more ready to be merry with Albinia than to moralize about her. And it was
      droll that the penny club was one of the first stages in her revival.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, mamma,&rsquo; cried Lucy, flying in, &lsquo;Mr. Dusautoy is at the door. There is
      such a to do. All the women have been getting gin with their penny club
      tickets, and Mrs. Brock has been stealing the money, and Mr. Dusautoy
      wants to know if you paid up three-and-fourpence for the Hancock
      children.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia instantly invited Mr. Dusautoy to explain in person, and he
      entered, hearty and pleasant as ever, but in great haste, for he had left
      his Fanny keeping the peace between five angry women, while he came out to
      collect evidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bayford clothing-club payments were collected by Mrs. Brock, the
      sexton&rsquo;s wife, and distributed by tickets to be produced at the various
      shops in the town. Mrs. Brock had detected some women exchanging their
      tickets for gin, and the offending parties retaliated by accusing her of
      embezzling the subscriptions, both parties launching into the usual amount
      of personalities and exaggerations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia&rsquo;s testimony cleared Mrs. Brock as to the three-and-fourpence, but
      she &lsquo;snuffed the battle from afar,&rsquo; and rushed into a scheme of taking the
      clothing-club into her own hands, collecting the pence, having the goods
      from London, and selling them herself&mdash;she would propose it on the
      very first opportunity to the Dusautoys. Winifred asked if she had not a
      good deal on her hands already.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear, I have the work in me of a young giant.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And will Mr. Kendal like it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He would never find it out unless I told him, and very possibly not then.
      Six months hence, perhaps, he may tell me he is glad that Lucy is inclined
      to useful pursuits, and that <i>is</i> approval, Winifred, much more than
      if I went and worried him about every little petty woman&rsquo;s matter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Every one to her taste,&rsquo; thought Winifred, who had begun to regard Mr.
      and Mrs. Kendal in the same relation as the king and queen at chess.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day before the christening, Mr. Ferrars brought back Gilbert and his
      own little Willie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through all the interchange of greetings, Gilbert would hardly let go
      Albinia&rsquo;s hand, and the moment her attention was free, he earnestly
      whispered, &lsquo;May I see my brother?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She took him upstairs at once. &lsquo;Let me look a little while,&rsquo; he said,
      hanging over the child with a sort of hungry fondness and curiosity. &lsquo;My
      brother! my brother!&rsquo; he repeated. &lsquo;It has rung in my ears every morning
      that I can say my brother once more, till I have feared it was a dream.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the sympathy Albinia cared for, come back again! &lsquo;I hope he will be
      a good brother to you,&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He must be good! he can&rsquo;t help it! He has you!&rsquo; said Gilbert. &lsquo;See, he is
      opening his eyes&mdash;oh! how blue! May I touch him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To be sure you may. He is not sugar,&rsquo; said Albinia, laughing. &lsquo;There&mdash;make
      an arm; you may have him if you like. Your left arm, you awkward man. Yes,
      that is right. You will do quite as well as I, who never touched a baby
      till Willie was born. There, sir, how do you like your brother Gilbert?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert held him reverently, and gave him back with a sigh when he seemed
      to have satiated his gaze and touch, and convinced himself that his new
      possession was substantial. &lsquo;I say,&rsquo; he added wistfully, &lsquo;did you think <i>that</i>
      name would bring ill-luck?
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew the name he meant, and answered, &lsquo;No, but your father could not
      have borne it. Besides, Gibbie, we would not think him <i>instead</i> of
      Edmund. No, he shall learn, to look up to his other brother as you do, and
      look to meeting and knowing him some day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert shivered at this, and made no opposition to her carrying him
      downstairs to his uncle, and then Gilbert hurried off for the basket of
      snowdrops that he had gathered early, from a favourite spot at Fairmead.
      That short absence seemed to have added double force to his affection; he
      could hardly bear to be away from her, and every moment when he could gain
      her ear, poured histories of the delights of Fairmead, where Mr. Ferrars
      had devoted himself to his amusement, and had made him happier than
      perhaps he had ever been in his life&mdash;he had had a taste of shooting,
      of skating, of snowballing&mdash;he had been useful and important in the
      village feasts, had dined twice at Colonel Bury&rsquo;s, and felt himself many
      degrees nearer manhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      To hear of her old haunts and friends from such enthusiastic lips,
      delighted Albinia, and her felicity with her baby, with Mr. Kendal, with
      her brother and his little son, was one of the brightest things in all the
      world&mdash;the fresh young loving bloom of her matronhood was even
      sweeter and more beautiful than her girlish days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor little frail, blighted Mrs. Dusautoy! Winifred could not help
      wondering if the contrast pained her, when in all the glory of her
      motherly thankfulness, Albinia carried her beautiful newly-christened
      Maurice Ferrars Kendal to the vicarage to show him off, lying so
      open-chested and dignified, in Genevieve&rsquo;s pretty work, with a sort of
      manly serenity already dawning on his baby brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Winifred need not have pitied the little lady. She would not have changed
      with Mrs. Kendal&mdash;no, not for that perfect health, usefulness, value&mdash;nor
      even for such a baby as that. No, indeed! She loved&mdash;she rejoiced in
      all her friend&rsquo;s sweet and precious gifts&mdash;but Mrs. Dusautoy had one
      gift that she prized above all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even grandmamma and Aunt Maria did justice to Master Maurice&rsquo;s
      attractions, at least in public, though it came round that Miss Meadows
      did not admire fat children, and when he had once been seen in Lucy&rsquo;s
      arms, an alarm arose that Mrs. Kendal would allow the girls to carry him
      about, till his weight made them crooked, but Albinia was too joyous to
      take their displeasure to heart, and it only served her for something to
      laugh at.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had a very happy christening party, chiefly juvenile, in honour of
      little Willie and of Francis and Emily Nugent. Albinia was so radiantly
      lively and good-natured, and her assistants, Winifred, Maurice, and Mr.
      Dusautoy, so kind, so droll, so inventive, that even Aunt Maria forgot
      herself in enjoyment and novelty, and was like a different person. Mr.
      Kendal looked at her with a pleased sad wonder, and told his wife it
      reminded him of what she had been when she was nearly the prettiest girl
      at Bayford. Gilbert devoted himself as usual to making Genevieve feel
      welcome; and she had likewise Willie Ferrars and Francis Nugent at her
      feet. Neither urchin would sit two inches away from her all the evening,
      and in all games she was obliged to obviate jealousies by being partner to
      both at once. Where there was no one to oppress her, she came out with all
      her natural grace and vivacity, and people of a larger growth than her
      little admirers were charmed with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy was obliging, ready, and useful, and looked very pretty, the only
      blot was the heavy dulness of poor Sophy, who seemed resolved to take
      pleasure in nothing. Winifred varied in opinion whether her moodiness
      arose from ill-health, or from jealousy of her little brother. This latter
      Albinia would not believe, especially as she saw that little Maurice&rsquo;s
      blue eyes were magnets that held the silent Sophy fast, but surly denials
      silenced her interrogations as to illness, and made her content to
      acquiesce in Lucy&rsquo;s explanation that Sophy was only cross because the
      Osborns and Drurys were not asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia did her duty handsomely by the two families a day or two after,
      for whatever reports might come round, they were always ready to receive
      her advances, and she only took notice of what she saw, instead of what
      she heard. Her brother helped Mr. Kendal through the party, and Winifred
      made a discovery that excited her more than Albinia thought warranted by
      any fact relating to the horde of Irish cousins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only think, Albinia, I have found out that poor Ellen O&rsquo;More is Mr.
      Goldsmith&rsquo;s sister!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed! But I am afraid I don&rsquo;t remember which Ellen O&rsquo;More is. You know
      I never undertake to recollect any but your real cousins out of the
      thirty-six.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For shame, Albinia, I have so often told you about Ellen. I&rsquo;m sure you
      can&rsquo;t forget. Her husband is my sister&rsquo;s brother-in-law&rsquo;s cousin.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, Winifred, Winifred!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I tell you, her husband is the third son of old Mr. O&rsquo;More of
      Ballymakilty, and was in the army.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! the half-pay officer with the twelve children in the cottage on the
      estate.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There now, I did think you would care when I told you of a soldier, a
      Waterloo man too, and you only call him a half-pay officer!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do remember,&rsquo; said Albinia, taking a little pity, &lsquo;that you used to be
      sorry for his good little English wife.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course. I knew she had married him very imprudently, but she has
      struggled gallantly with ill-health, and poverty, and Irish recklessness.
      I quite venerate her, and it seems these Goldsmiths had so far cast her
      off that they had no notion of the extent of her troubles.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just like them,&rsquo; said Albinia. &lsquo;Is that the reason you wish me to make
      the most of the connexion? Let me see, my sister-in-law&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s wife&mdash;no,
      husband&rsquo;s brother&rsquo;s uncle, eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to do anything,&rsquo; said Winifred, a little hurt, &lsquo;only if
      you had seen Ellen&rsquo;s patient face you would be interested in her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I am interested, you know I am, Winifred. I hope you interested our
      respected banker, which would be more to the purpose.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think I did,&rsquo; said Winifred; &lsquo;at least he said &ldquo;poor Ellen&rdquo; once or
      twice. I don&rsquo;t want him to do anything for the captain, you might give him
      a thousand pounds and he would never be the better for it: but that
      fourth, boy, Ulick, is without exception the nicest fellow I ever saw in
      my life&mdash;so devoted to his mother, so much more considerate and
      self-denying than any of the others, and very clever. Maurice examined him
      and was quite astonished. We did get him sent to St. Columba for the
      present, but whether they will keep him there no one can guess, and it is
      the greatest pity he should run to waste. I told Mr. Goldsmith all this,
      and I really think he seemed to attend. I wonder if it will work.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia was by this time anxious that it should take effect, and they
      agreed that an old bachelor banker and his sister, both past sixty, were
      the very people to adopt a promising nephew.
    </p>
    <p>
      What had become of the multitude of things which Albinia had to discuss
      with her brother? The floodtide of bliss had floated her over all the
      stumbling-blocks and shoals that the ebb had disclosed, and she had
      absolutely forgotten all the perplexities that had seemed so trying. Even
      when she sought a private interview to talk to him about Gilbert, it was
      in full security of hearing the praises of her darling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A nice boy, a very nice boy,&rsquo; returned Maurice; &lsquo;most amiable and
      intelligent, and particularly engaging, from his feeling being so much on
      the surface.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing can be more sincere and genuine,&rsquo; she cried, as if this fell a
      little flat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly not, at the time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Always!&rsquo; exclaimed Albinia. &lsquo;You must not distrust him because he is not
      like you or Fred, and has never been hardened and taught reserve by rude
      boys. Nothing was ever more real than his affection, poor dear boy,&rsquo; and
      the tears thrilled to her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, and it is much to his credit. His love and gratitude to you are quite
      touching, poor fellow; but the worst of it is that I am afraid he is very
      timid, both physically and morally.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Often as she had experienced this truth, the soldier&rsquo;s daughter could not
      bear to avow it, and she answered hastily, &lsquo;He has never been braced or
      trained; he was always ill till within the last few years&mdash;coddling
      at first, neglect afterwards, he has it all to learn, and it is too late
      for school.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, he is too old to be laughed at or bullied out of cowardice. Indeed,
      I doubt whether there ever would have been substance enough for much wear
      and tear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know you have a turn for riotous, obstinate boys! You want Willie to be
      another Fred,&rsquo; said Albinia, like an old hen, ruffling up her feathers.
      &lsquo;You think a boy can&rsquo;t be good for anything unless he is a universal
      plague!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wonder what you will do with your own son,&rsquo; said Maurice, amused,
      &lsquo;since you take Gilbert&rsquo;s part so fiercely.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I trust my boy will never be as much to be pitied as his brother,&rsquo; said
      Albinia, with tenderness that accused her petulance. &lsquo;At least he can
      never be a lonely twin with that sore spot in his heart. Oh, Maurice, how
      can any one help dealing gently with my poor Gibbie?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gentle dealing is the very thing he wants,&rsquo; said Mr. Ferrars; &lsquo;and I am
      thinking how to find it for him. How did his going to Traversham fail?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know; Edmund did not like to send him without having seen
      Traversham, and I could not go. But I don&rsquo;t think there is any need for
      his going away. His father has been quite enough tormented about it, and I
      can manage him very well now. He is always good and happy with me. I mean
      to try to ride with him, and I have promised to teach him music, and we
      shall garden. Never fear, I will employ him and keep him out of mischief&mdash;it
      is all pleasure to me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And pray what are your daughters and baby to do, while you are galloping
      after Gilbert?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! I&rsquo;ll manage. We can all do things together. Come, Maurice, I wont
      have Edmund teased, and I can&rsquo;t bear parting with any of them, or think
      that any strange man can treat Gibbie as I should.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Maurice was edified by his sister&rsquo;s warm-hearted weakness, but not at all
      inclined to let &lsquo;Edmund&rsquo; escape a &lsquo;teasing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kendal&rsquo;s first impulse always was to find a sufficient plea for doing
      nothing. If Gilbert was to go to India, it was not worth while to give him
      a classical education.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is he to go to India? Albinia had not told me so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thought she was aware of it; but possibly I may not have mentioned it.
      It has been an understood thing ever since I came home. He will have a
      good deal of the property in this place, but he had better have seen
      something of the world. Bayford is no place for a man to settle down in
      too young.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly,&rsquo; said Mr. Ferrars, repressing a smile. &lsquo;Then are you thinking
      of sending him to Haileybury?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He was pronounced too young, besides, it was explained that his
      destination in India was unfixed. On going home it had been a kind of
      promise that one of the twin brothers should have an appointment in the
      civil service, the other should enter the bank of Kendal and Kendal, and
      the survivor was unconsciously suspended between these alternatives, while
      the doubt served as a convenient protection to his father from making up
      his mind to prepare him for either of these or for anything else.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prompt Ferrars temper could bear it no longer, and Maurice spoke out.
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what, Kendal, it is time to attend to your own concerns. If
      you choose to let your son run to ruin, because you will not exert
      yourself to remove him from temptation, I shall not stand by to see my
      sister worn out with making efforts to save him. She is willing and
      devoted, she fancies she could work day and night to preserve him, and she
      does it with all her heart; but it is not woman&rsquo;s work, she cannot do it,
      and it is not fit to leave it to her. When Gilbert has broken her heart as
      well as yours, and left an evil example to his brother, then you will feel
      what it is to have kept a lad whom you know to be well disposed, but weak
      as water, in the very midst of contamination, and to have left your young,
      inexperienced wife to struggle alone to save him. If you are unwarned by
      the experience of last autumn and winter, I could not pity you, whatever
      might happen.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Maurice, who had run on the longer because Mr. Kendal did not answer
      immediately, was shocked at his own impetuosity; but a rattling peal of
      thunder was not more than was requisite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I believe you are right,&rsquo; Mr. Kendal said. &lsquo;I was to blame for leaving
      him so entirely to Albinia; but she is very fond of him, and is one who
      will never be induced to spare herself, and there were considerations.
      However, she shall be relieved at once. What do you recommend?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ferrars actually made Mr. Kendal promise to set out for Traversham
      with him next morning, thirty miles by the railway, to inspect Mr. Downton
      and his pupils.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia had just sense enough not to object, though the discovery of the
      Indian plans was such a blow to her that she could not be consoled by all
      her husband&rsquo;s representations of the advantages Gilbert would derive
      there, and of his belief that the Kendal constitution always derived
      strength from a hot climate, and that to himself going to India seemed
      going home. She took refuge in the hope that between the two Indian stools
      Gilbert might fall upon one of the professions which she thought alone
      worthy of man&rsquo;s attention, the clerical or the military.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under Maurice&rsquo;s escort, Mr. Kendal greatly enjoyed his expedition; liked
      Traversham, was satisfied with the looks of the pupils, and very much
      pleased with the tutor, whom he even begged to come to Bayford for a
      conference with Mrs. Kendal, and this was received by her as no small
      kindness. She was delighted with Mr. Downton, and felt as if Gilbert could
      be safely trusted in his charge; nor was Gilbert himself reluctant. He was
      glad to escape from his tempter, and to begin a new life, and though he
      hung about Mrs. Kendal, and implored her to write often, and always tell
      him about his little brother&mdash;nay, though he cried like a child at
      the last, yet still he was happy and satisfied to go, and to break the
      painful fetters which had held him so long.
    </p>
    <p>
      And though Albinia likewise shed some parting tears, she could not but own
      that she was glad to have him in trustworthy hands; and as to the
      additional time thus gained, it was disposed of in a million of bright
      plans for every one&rsquo;s service&mdash;daughters, baby, parish, school,
      classes, clubs, neighbours. It almost made Winifred giddy to hear how much
      she had undertaken, and yet with what zest she talked and acted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s your victim, Winifred,&rsquo; said Maurice, as they drove away, and
      looked back at Albinia, scandalizing Bayford by standing in the open
      gateway, her face all smiles of cheerful parting, the sun and wind making
      merry with her chestnut curls, her baby in one arm, the other held up to
      wave her farewell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That child will catch cold,&rsquo; began Winifred, turning to sign her to go
      in. &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; she continued, &lsquo;after all, I believe some people like an idol
      that sits quiet to be worshipped! To be sure she must want to beat him
      sometimes, as the Africans do their gods. But, on the whole, her sentiment
      of reverence is satisfied, and she likes the acting for herself, and
      reigning absolute. Yes, she is quite happy&mdash;why do you look doubtful?
      Don&rsquo;t you admire her?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;From my heart.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then why do you doubt? Do you expect her to do anything?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A little too much of everything.&rsquo; 
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Yes! Albinia was excessively happy. Her naturally high spirits were
      enhanced by the enjoyment of recovery, and reaction, from her former
      depression. Since the great stroke of the drainage, every one looked
      better, and her pride in her babe was without a drawback. He seemed to
      have inherited her vigour and superabundance of life, and &lsquo;that first
      wondrous spring to all but babes unknown,&rsquo; was in him unusually rapid, so
      that he was a marvel of fair stateliness, size, strength, and
      intelligence, so unlike the little blighted buds which had been wont to
      fade at Willow Lawn, that his father watched him with silent, wondering
      affection, and his eldest sister was unmerciful in her descriptions of his
      progress; while even Sophia had not been proof against his smiles, and was
      proud to be allowed to carry him about and fondle him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither was Mr. Kendal&rsquo;s reserve the trial that it had once been. After
      having become habituated to it as a necessary idiosyncrasy, she had become
      rather proud of his lofty inaccessibility. Besides, her brother&rsquo;s visit,
      her recovery, and the renewed hope and joy in this promising child, had
      not been without effect in rousing him from his apathy. He was less
      inclined to shun his fellow-creatures, had become friendly with the Vicar,
      and had even let Albinia take him into Mrs. Dusautoy&rsquo;s drawing-room, where
      he had been fairly happy. Having once begun taking his wife out in the
      carriage, he found this much more agreeable than his solitary ride, and
      was in the condition to which Albinia had once imagined it possible to
      bring him, in which gentle means and wholesome influence might lead him
      imperceptibly out of his morbid habits of self-absorption.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, in the flush of blitheness and whirl of activity, Albinia
      failed to perceive the relative importance of objects, and he had taught
      her to believe herself so little necessary to him that she had not learnt
      to make her pursuits and occupations subservient to his convenience. As
      long as the drive took place regularly, all was well, but he caught a
      severe cold, which lasted even to the setting in of the east winds, the
      yearly misery of a man who hardly granted that India was over-hot. Though
      Albinia had removed much listing, and opened various doors and windows, he
      made no complaints, but did his best to keep the obnoxious fresh air out
      of his study, and seldom crossed the threshold thereof but with a shiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      His favourite atmosphere was quite enough to account for a return of the
      old mood, but Albinia had no time to perceive that it might have been
      prevented, or at least mitigated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Few even of the wisest women are fit for authority and liberty so little
      restrained, and happily it seldom falls to the lot of such as have not
      previously been chastened by a life-long affliction. But Mrs. Kendal, at
      twenty-four, with the consequence conferred by marriage, and by her
      superiority of manners and birth, was left as unchecked and almost as
      irresponsible as if she had been single or a widow, and was solely guided
      by the impulses of her own character, noble and highly principled, but
      like most zealous dispositions, without balance and without repose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ballast had been given at first by bashfulness, disappointment, and
      anxiety, but she had been freed from her troubles with Gilbert, had gained
      confidence in herself, and had taken her position at Bayford. She was
      beloved, esteemed, and trusted in her own set, and though elsewhere she
      might not be liked, yet she was deferred to, could not easily be
      quarrelled with, so that she met with little opposition, and did not care
      for such as she did meet. In fact, very few persons had so much of their
      own way as Mrs. Kendal.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was generally in her nursery at a much earlier hour than an
      old-established nurse would have tolerated, but the little Susan, promoted
      from Fairmead school and nursery, was trained in energetic habits. In
      passing the doors of the young ladies&rsquo; rooms, Albinia gave a call which
      she had taught them not to resist, for, like all strong persons, she
      thought &lsquo;early to rise&rsquo; the only way to health, wealth, or wisdom. Much
      work had been despatched before breakfast, after which, on two days in the
      week, Albinia and Lucy went to church. Sophy never volunteered to
      accompany them, and Albinia was the less inclined to press her, because
      her attitudes and attention on Sunday were far from satisfactory. On
      Tuesday and Thursday Albinia had a class at school, and so, likewise, had
      Lucy, who kept a jealous watch over every stray necklace and curl, and had
      begun thoroughly to enjoy the importance and bustle of charity. She was a
      useful assistant in the penny club and lending library, which occupied
      Albinia on other mornings in the week, until the hour when she came in for
      the girls&rsquo; studies. After luncheon, she enjoyed the company of little
      Maurice, who indeed pervaded all her home doings and thoughts, for she had
      a great gift of doing everything at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sharp constitutional walk was taken in the afternoon. She thought no one
      could look drooping or dejected but from the air of the valley, and that
      no cure was equal to rushing straight up one hill and on to the next,
      always walking rapidly, with a springy buoyant step, and surprised at any
      one who lagged behind. Parochial cares, visits, singing classes, lessons
      to Sunday-school teachers, &amp;c., filled up the rest of the day. She had
      an endless number of &lsquo;excellent plans,&rsquo; on which she always acted
      instantly, and which kept her in a state of perpetual haste. Poor Mrs.
      Dusautoy had almost learnt to dread her flashing into the room, full of
      some parish matter, and flashing out again before the invalid felt as if
      the subject had been fairly entered on, or her sitting down to impress
      some project with overpowering eagerness that generally carried away the
      Vicar into grateful consent and admiring approval, while his wife was
      feeling doubtful, suspecting her hesitation of being ungracious, or
      blaming herself for not liking the little she could do to be taken out of
      her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing more hateful to Albinia than dawdling. She left the
      girls&rsquo; choice of employments, but insisted on their being veritably
      occupied, and many a time did she encounter a killing glance from Sophia
      for attacking her listless, moody position in her chair, or saying, in
      clear, alert tones, &lsquo;My dear, when you read, read, when you work, work.
      When you fix your eye in that way, you are doing neither.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy&rsquo;s brisk, active disposition, and great good-humour, had responded to
      this treatment; she had been obliging, instead of officious; repeated
      checks had improved her taste; her love of petty bustle was directed to
      better objects, and though nothing could make her intellectual or deep,
      she was a really pleasant assistant and companion, and no one, except
      grandmamma, who thought her perfect before, could fail to perceive how
      much more lady-like her tones, manners, and appearance had become.
    </p>
    <p>
      The results with Sophy had been directly the reverse. At first she had
      followed her sister&rsquo;s lead, except that she was always sincere, and often
      sulky; but the more Lucy had yielded to Albinia&rsquo;s moulding, the more had
      Sophy diverged from her, as if out of the very spirit of contradiction.
      Her intervals of childish nonsense had well nigh disappeared; her
      indifference to lessons was greater than ever, though she devoured every
      book that came in her way in a silent, but absorbed manner, a good deal
      like her father. Tales and stories were not often within her reach, but
      her appetite seemed to be universal, and Albinia saw her reading
      old-fashioned standard poetry&mdash;such as she had never herself assailed&mdash;and
      books of history, travels, or metaphysics. She wondered whether the girl
      derived any pleasure from them, or whether they were only a shield for
      doing nothing; but no inquiry produced an answer, and if Sophy remembered
      anything of them, it was not with the memory used in lesson-time. The
      attachment to Louisa Osborn was pertinacious and unaccountable in a person
      who could have so little in common with that young lady, and there was
      nothing comfortable about her except her fondness for her little brother,
      and that really seemed to be against her will. Her voice was less hoarse
      and gruff since the pond had been no more, and she had acquired an
      expression, so suffering, so concentrated, so thoughtful, that, together
      with her heavy black eyebrows, large face, profuse black hair, and
      unlustrous eyes, it gave her almost a dwarfish air, increased by her
      awkward deportment, which concealed that she was in reality tall, and on a
      large scale. She looked to so little advantage in bright delicate colours,
      that Albinia was often incurring her displeasure, and risking that of
      Lucy, by the deep blues and sober browns which alone looked fit to be seen
      with those beetle brows and sallow features. Her face looked many years
      older than that of her fair, fresh, rosy stepmother; nay, her father&rsquo;s
      clear olive complexion and handsome countenance had hardly so aged an
      aspect; and Gilbert, when he came home at Midsummer, declared that Sophy
      had grown as old as grandmamma.
    </p>
    <p>
      The compliment could not be returned; Gilbert was much more boy-like in a
      good sense. He had brought home an excellent character, and showed it in
      every look and gesture. His father was pleased to have him again, took the
      trouble to talk to him, and received such sensible answers, that the habit
      of conversing was actually established, and the dinners were enlivened,
      instead of oppressed, by his presence. Towards his sisters he had become
      courteous, he was fairly amiable to Aunt Maria, very attentive to
      grandmamma, overflowing with affection to Mrs. Kendal, and as to little
      Maurice, he almost adored him, and awakened a reciprocity which was the
      delight of his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Midsummer came the grand penny-club distribution, the triumph for which
      Albinia had so long been preparing. One of Mrs. Dusautoy&rsquo;s hints as to
      Bayford tradesmen had been overruled, and goods had been ordered from a
      house in London, after Albinia and Lucy had made an incredible agitation
      over their patterns of calico and flannel. Mr. Kendal was just aware that
      there was a prodigious commotion, but he knew that all ladies were subject
      to linen-drapery epidemics, and Albinia&rsquo;s took a more endurable form than
      a pull on his purse for the sweetest silk in the world, and above all, it
      neither came into his study nor even into his house.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a grand spectacle, when Mr. Dusautoy looked in on Mrs. Kendal and
      her staff, armed with their yard-wands.
    </p>
    <p>
      A pile of calico was heaped in wild masses like avalanches in one corner,
      rapidly diminishing under the measurements of Gilbert, who looked as if he
      took thorough good-natured delight in the frolic. Brown, inodorous
      materials for petticoats, blouses, and trowsers were dealt out by the
      dextrous hands of Genevieve, a mountain of lilac print was folded off by
      Clarissa Richardson, Lucy was presiding joyously over the various blue,
      buff, brown, and pink Sunday frocks, the schoolmistress helping with the
      other goods, the customers&mdash;some pleased with novelty, or hoping to
      get more for their money, others suspicious of the gentry, and secretly
      resentful for favourite dealers, but, except the desperate grumblers,
      satisfied with the quality and quantity of the wares&mdash;and extremely
      taken with the sellers, especially with Gilbert&rsquo;s wit, and with Miss
      Durant&rsquo;s ready, lively persuasions, varied to each one&rsquo;s taste, and
      extracting a smile and &lsquo;thank you, Miss,&rsquo; from the surliest. And the
      presiding figure, with the light on her sunny hair, and good-natured,
      unfailing interest in her countenance, was at her central table,
      calculating, giving advice, considering of complaints, measuring, folding&mdash;here,
      there, and everywhere&mdash;always bright, lively, forbearing, however
      complaining or unreasonable her clients might be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dusautoy went home to tell his Fanny that Mrs. Kendal was worth her
      weight in gold; and the workers toiled till luncheon, when Albinia took
      them home for food and wine, to restore them for the labours of the
      afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What have you been about all the morning, Sophy? Yes, I see your
      translation&mdash;very well&mdash;I wish you would come up and help this
      afternoon, Miss Richardson is looking so pale and tired that I want to
      relieve her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said Sophy,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t order you, but you are losing a great deal of fun. Suppose you
      came to look on, at least.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hate poor people.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope you will change your mind some day, but you must do something this
      afternoon. You had better take a walk with Susan and baby; I told her to
      go by the meadows to Horton.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want to walk.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you anything to do instead? No, I thought not, and it is not at all
      hot to signify.&mdash;It will do you much more good. Yes, you must go.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of the summer an old Indian friend was staying at Fairmead
      Park, and Colonel Bury wrote to beg for a week&rsquo;s visit from the whole
      Kendal family. Even Sophy vouchsafed to be pleased, and Lucy threw all her
      ardour into the completion of a blue braided cape, which was to add
      immensely to little Maurice&rsquo;s charms; she declared that she should work at
      it the whole of the last evening, while Mr. and Mrs. Kendal were at the
      dinner that old Mr. and Mrs. Bowles annually inflicted on themselves and
      their neighbours, a dinner which it would have been as cruel to refuse as
      it was irksome to accept.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a great similarity in those Bayford parties, inasmuch as the
      same cook dressed them all, and the same waiters waited at them, and the
      same guests met each other, and the principal variety on this occasion
      was, that the Osborns did not come, because the Admiral was in London.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ladies had left the dining-room, when Albinia&rsquo;s ear caught a sound of
      hurried opening of doors, and sound of steps, and saw Mrs. and Miss Bowles
      look as if they heard something unexpected. She paused, and forgot the end
      of what she was saying. The room door was pushed a little way open, but
      then seemed to hesitate. Miss Bowles hastened forward, and opening it,
      admitted a voice that made Albinia hurry breathlessly from the other side
      of the room, and push so that the door yielded, and she saw it had been
      Mr. Dusautoy who had been holding it while there was some kind of
      consultation round Gilbert. The instant he saw her, he exclaimed, &lsquo;Come to
      the baby, Sophy has fallen down with him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      People pressed about her, trying to speak cheeringly, but she understood
      nothing but that her husband and Mr. Bowles were gone on, and she had a
      sense that there had been hardness and cruelty in hesitating to summon
      her. Without knowing that a shawl was thrown round her, or seeing Mr.
      Dusautoy&rsquo;s offered arm, she clutched Gilbert&rsquo;s wrist in her hand, and flew
      down the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gates and front door were open, and there was a throng of people in
      the hall. Lucy caught hold of her with a sobbing, &lsquo;Oh, Mamma!&rsquo; but she
      only framed the words with her lips&mdash;&lsquo;where?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They pointed to the study. The door was shut, but Albinia broke from Lucy,
      and pushed through it, in too much haste to dwell on the sickening doubt
      what it might conceal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two figures stood under the window. Mr. Kendal, who was holding the little
      inanimate form in his arms for the doctor to examine, looking up as she
      entered, cast on her a look of mute, pleading, despairing agony, that was
      as the bitterness of death. She sprang forward herself to clasp her child,
      and her husband yielded him in broken-hearted pity, but at that moment the
      little limbs moved, the features worked, the eyes unclosed, and clinging
      tightly to her, as she strained him to her bosom, the little fellow
      proclaimed himself alive by lusty roars, more welcome than any music.
      Partly stunned, and far more terrified, he had been in a sort of swoon,
      without breath to cry, till recalled to himself by feeling his mother&rsquo;s
      arms around him. Every attempt of Mr. Bowles to ascertain whether he were
      uninjured produced such a fresh panic and renewal of screams, that she
      begged that he might be left to her. Mr. Kendal took the doctor away, and
      gradually the terror subsided, though the long convulsive sobs still
      quivered up through the little frame, and as the twilight darkened on her,
      she had time to realize the past alarm, and rejoice in trembling over the
      treasure still her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      The opening of the door and the gleaming of a light had nearly brought on
      a fresh access of crying, but it was his father who entered, and Maurice
      knew the low deep sweetness of his voice, and was hushed. &lsquo;I believe there
      is no harm done,&rsquo; Albinia said; and the smile that she fain would have
      made reassuring gave way as her eyes filled with tears, on feeling the
      trembling of the strong arm that was put round her, when Mr. Kendal bent
      to look into the child&rsquo;s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thought my blight had fallen on you,&rsquo; was all he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! the thankfulness&mdash;&rsquo; she said; but she could not go on, she must
      stifle all that swelled within her, for the babe felt each throb of her
      beating heart; and she could barely keep from bursting into tears as his
      father kissed him; then, as he marked the still sobbing breath, said,
      &lsquo;Bowles must see him again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know how to make him cry again! I suppose he must be looked at,
      but indeed I think him safe.&mdash;See, this little bruise on his forehead
      is the only mark I can find. What was it? How did it happen?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sophia thought proper to take him herself from the nursery to show him to
      Mrs. Osborn. In crossing the street, she was frightened by a party of men
      coming out of a public-house in Tibbs&rsquo;s Alley, and in avoiding them,
      slipped down and struck the child&rsquo;s head against a gate-post. He was
      perfectly insensible when I took him&mdash;I thought him gone. Albinia,
      you must let Bowles see him again!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is any one there?&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Every one, I think,&rsquo; he replied, looking oppressed&mdash;&lsquo;Maria, and Mrs.
      Osborn, and Dusautoy&mdash;but I will call Bowles.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Apparently the little boy had escaped entirely unhurt, but the surgeon
      still spoke of the morrow, and he was so startled and restless, that
      Albinia feared to move, and felt the dark study a refuge from the voices
      and sounds that she feared to encounter, lest they should again occasion
      the dreadful screaming. &lsquo;Oh, if they would only go home!&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will send them,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal; and presently she heard sounds of
      leave-taking, and he came back, as if he had been dispersing a riot,
      announcing that the house was clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert and Lucy were watching at the foot of the stairs, the one pale,
      and casting anxious, imploring looks at her; the other with eyes red and
      swollen with crying, neither venturing near till she spoke to them, when
      they advanced noiselessly to look at their little brother, and it was not
      till they had caught his eye and made him smile, that Lucy bethought
      herself of saying she had known nothing of his adventure, and Albinia,
      thus recalled to the thought of the culprit, asked where Sophy was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In her own room,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal. &lsquo;I could not bear the sight of her
      obduracy. Even her aunt was shocked at her want of feeling.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Low as he spoke, the sternness of his voice frightened the baby, and she
      was obliged to run away to the nursery, where she listened to the
      contrition of the little nursemaid, who had never suspected Miss Sophy&rsquo;s
      intention of taking him out of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And indeed, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;there is not one of us servants who dares
      cross Miss Sophy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was long before Albinia ventured to lay him in his cot, and longer
      still before she could feel any security that if she ceased her low,
      monotonous lullaby, the little fellow would not wake again in terror, but
      the thankfulness and prayer, that, as she grew more calm, gained fuller
      possession of her heart, made her recur the more to pity and forgiveness
      for the poor girl who had caused the alarm. Yet there was strong
      indignation likewise, and she could not easily resolve on meeting the hard
      defiance and sullen indifference which would wound her more than ever. She
      was much inclined to leave Sophy to herself till morning, but suspecting
      that this would be vindictive, she unclasped the arm that Lucy had wound
      round her waist, whispered to her to go on singing, and moved to Sophy&rsquo;s
      door. It was fastened, but before she could call, it was thrown violently
      back, and Sophy stood straight up before her, striving for her usual
      rigidity, but shaking from head to foot; and though there were no signs of
      tears, she looked with wistful terror at her step-mother&rsquo;s face, and her
      lips moved as if she wished to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Baby is gone quietly to sleep,&rsquo; began Albinia in a low voice, beginning
      in displeasure; but as she spoke, the harshness of Sophy&rsquo;s face gave way,
      she sank down on the floor, and fell into the most overpowering fit of
      weeping that Albinia had ever witnessed. Kneeling beside her, she would
      have drawn the girl close to her, but a sharp cry of pain startled her,
      and she found the right arm, from elbow to wrist, all one purple bruise,
      the skin grazed, and the blood starting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My poor child! how you have hurt yourself!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy turned away pettishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let me look! I am sure it must be very bad. Have you done anything to
      it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, never mind. Go back to baby.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Baby does not want me. You shall come and see how comfortably he is
      asleep, if you will leave off crying, and let me see that poor arm. Did
      you hurt it in the fall?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The corner of the wall,&rsquo; said Sophy. &lsquo;Oh! did it not hurt him?&rsquo; but then,
      just as it seemed that she was sinking on that kind breast in exhaustion,
      she collected herself, and pushing Albinia off, exclaimed, &lsquo;I did it, I
      took him out, I fell down with him, I hurt his head, I&rsquo;ve killed him, or
      made him an idiot for life. I did.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who said so?&rsquo; cried Albinia, transfixed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aunt Maria said so. She said I did not feel. Oh, if I could only die
      before he grows up to let one see it. Why wont you begin to hate me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear,&rsquo; said Albinia, consoled on hearing the authority, &lsquo;people often
      say angry things when they are shocked. Your aunt had not seen Mr. Bowles,
      and we all think he was not in the least hurt, only terribly frightened.
      Dear, dear child, I am more distressed for you than for him!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy could hold out no longer, she let her head drop on the kind
      shoulder, and seemed to collapse, with burning brow, throbbing pulses, and
      sobs as deep and convulsive as had been those of her little brother.
      Hastily calling Lucy, who was frightened, subdued, and helpful, Albinia
      undressed the poor child, put her to bed, and applied lily leaves and
      spirits to her arm. The smart seemed to refresh her, but there had been a
      violent strain, as well as bruise, and each touch visibly gave severe
      pain, though she never complained. Lucy insisted on hearing exactly how
      the accident had happened, and pressed her with questions, which Albinia
      would have shunned in her present condition, and it was thus elicited that
      she had taken Maurice across the street to how him to Mrs. Osborn. He had
      resented the strange place, and strange people, and had cried so much that
      she was obliged to run home with him at once. A knot of bawling men came
      reeling out of one of the many beer shops in Tibbs&rsquo;s Alley, and in her
      haste to avoid them, she tripped, close to the gate-post of Willow Lawn,
      and fell, with only time to interpose her arm between Maurice&rsquo;s head and
      the sharp corner. She was lifted up at once, in the horror of seeing him
      neither cry nor move, for, in fact, he had been almost stifled under her
      weight, and all had since been to her a frightful phantom dream. Albinia
      was infinitely relieved by this history, showing that Maurice could hardly
      have received any real injury, and in her declarations that Sophy&rsquo;s
      presence of mind had saved him, was forgetting to whom the accident was
      owing. Lucy wanted to know why her sister could have taken him out of the
      house at all, but Albinia could not bear to have this pressed at such a
      moment, and sent the inquirer down to order some tea, which she shared
      with Sophy, and then was forced to bid her good-night, without drawing out
      any further confessions. But when the girl raised herself to receive her
      kiss, it was the first real embrace that had passed between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the very early morning, Albinia was in the nursery, and found her
      little boy bright and healthy. As she left him in glad hope and gratitude,
      Sophy&rsquo;s door was pushed ajar, and her wan face peeped out. &lsquo;My dear child,
      you have not been asleep all night!&rsquo; exclaimed Albinia, after having
      satisfied her about the baby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Does your arm hurt you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Does your head ache?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Rather.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But they were not the old sulky answers, and she seemed glad to have her
      arm freely bathed, her brow cooled, her tossed bed composed, and her
      window opened, so that she might make a fresh attempt at closing her weary
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was evidently far too much shaken to be fit for the intended
      expedition, even if her father had not decreed that she should be deprived
      of it. Albinia had never seen him so much incensed, for nothing makes a
      man so angry as to have been alarmed; and he was doubly annoyed when he
      found that she thought Sophy too unwell to be left, as he intended, to
      solitary confinement.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would gladly have given up the visit, for his repugnance to society was
      in full force on the eve of a party; but Albinia, by representing that it
      would be wrong to disappoint Colonel Bury, and very hard on the
      unoffending Gilbert and Lucy, succeeded in prevailing on him to accept his
      melancholy destiny, and to allow her to remain at home with Sophy and the
      baby&mdash;one of the greatest sacrifices he or she had yet made. He was
      exceedingly vexed, and therefore the less disposed to be lenient. The more
      Albinia told him of Sophy&rsquo;s unhappiness, the more he hoped it would do her
      good, and he could not be induced to see her, nor to send her any message
      of forgiveness, for in truth it was less the baby&rsquo;s accident that he
      resented, than the eighteen months of surly resistance to the baby&rsquo;s
      mother, and at present he was more unrelenting than the generous,
      forgiving spirit of his wife could understand, though she tried to believe
      it manly severity and firmness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It would be time to pardon,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;when pardon was asked.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And Albinia could not say that it had been asked, except by misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She has the best advocate in you,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal, affectionately, &lsquo;and
      if there be any feeling in her, such forbearance cannot fail to bring it
      out. I am more grieved than I can tell you at your present disappointment,
      but it shall not happen again. If you can bring her to a better mind, I
      shall be the more satisfied in sending her from home.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Edmund! you do not think of it!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My mind is made up. Do you think I have not watched your patient care,
      and the manner in which it has been repaid? You have sufficient occupation
      without being the slave of those children&rsquo;s misconduct.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sophy would be miserable. Oh! you must not! She is the last girl in the
      world fit to be sent to school.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will not have you made miserable at home. This has been a long trial,
      and nothing has softened her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Suppose this was the very thing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If it were, what is past should not go unrequited, and the change will
      teach her what she has rejected. Hush, dearest, it is not that I do not
      think that you have done all for her that tenderness or good sense could
      devise, but your time is too much occupied, and I cannot see you
      overtasked by this poor child&rsquo;s headstrong temper. It is decided, Albinia;
      say no more.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have failed,&rsquo; thought Albinia, as he left the room. &lsquo;He decides that I
      have failed in bringing up his children. What have I done? Have I been
      mistaken? have I been careless? have I not prayed enough? Oh! my poor,
      poor Sophy! What will she do among strange girls? Oh! how wretched, how
      harsh, how misunderstood she will be! She will grow worse and worse, and
      just when I do think I might have begun to get at her! And it is for my
      sake! For me that her father is set against her, and is driving her out
      from her home! Oh! what shall I do? Winifred will promote it, because they
      all think I am doing too much! I wonder what put that in Edmund&rsquo;s head?
      But when he speaks in that way, I have no hope!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kendal&rsquo;s anger took a direction with which she better sympathized when
      he walked down Tibbs&rsquo;s Alley, and counted the nine beer shops, which had
      never dawned on his imagination, and which so greatly shocked it, that he
      went straight to the astonished Pettilove, and gave him a severe reprimand
      for allowing the houses to be made dens of iniquity and disorder.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was at home in time to meet the doctor, and hear that Maurice had
      suffered not the smallest damage; and then to make another ineffectual
      attempt to persuade Albinia to consign Sophy to imprisonment with Aunt
      Maria; after which he drove off very much against his will with Lucy and
      Gilbert, both declaring that they did not care a rush to go to Fairmead
      under the present circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia had a sad, sore sense of failure, and almost of guilt, as she
      lingered on the door-step after seeing them set off. The education of
      &lsquo;Edmund&rsquo;s children&rsquo; had been a cherished vision, and it had resulted so
      differently from her expectations, that her heart sank. With Gilbert there
      was indeed no lack of love and confidence, but there was a sad lurking
      sense of his want of force of character, and she had avowedly been
      insufficient to preserve him from temptation; Lucy, whom externally she
      had the most altered, was not of a nature accordant enough with her own
      for her to believe the effects deep or permanent; and Sophia&mdash;poor
      Sophia! Had what was kindly called forbearance been really neglect and
      want of moral courage? Would a gentler, less eager person have won instead
      of repelling confidence? Had her multiplicity of occupations made her give
      but divided attention to the more important home duty. Alas! alas! she
      only knew that her husband thought his daughter beyond her management, and
      for that very reason she would have given worlds to retain the uncouth,
      perverse girl under her charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood loitering, for the sound of the river and the shade of the
      willows were pleasant on the glowing July day, and having made all her
      arrangements for going from home, she had no pressing employment, and thus
      she waited, musing as she seldom allowed herself time to do, and thinking
      over each phase of her conduct towards Sophy, in the endeavour to detect
      the mistake; and throughout came, not exactly answering her query, but
      throwing a light upon it, her brother&rsquo;s warning, that if she did not
      resign herself to rest quietly when rest was forced upon her, she would
      work amiss when she did work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then came a swinging of the gate, a step on the walk, and Miss
      Meadows made her appearance. A message had been sent up in the morning,
      but grandmamma was so nervous, that Maria had trotted down in the heat so
      satisfy her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia was surprised to find that womanhood had thrown all their
      instincts on the baby&rsquo;s side, and was gratified by the first truly kind
      fellow-feeling they had shown her. She took Maria into the morning room,
      where she had left Sophy lying on the sofa, and ran up to fetch Maurice
      from the nursery.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she came down, having left the nurse adorning him, she found that she
      had acted cruelly. Sophy was standing up with her hardest face on,
      listening to her aunt&rsquo;s well-meant rebukes on her want of feeling, and
      hopes that she did regret the having endangered her brother, and deprived
      &lsquo;her dear mamma of the party of pleasure at Fairmead; but Aunt Maria knew
      it was of no use to talk to Sophy, none&mdash;!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pray don&rsquo;t, Aunt Maria,&rsquo; said Albinia, gently drawing Sophy down on the
      sofa again; &lsquo;this poor child is in no state to be scolded.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are a great deal too good to her, Mrs. Kendal&mdash;after such
      wilfulness as last night&mdash;carrying the dear baby out in the street&mdash;I
      never heard of such a thing&mdash;But what made you do it, Sophy, wont you
      tell me that? No, I know you won&rsquo;t; no one ever can get a word from her.
      Ah! that sulky disposition&mdash;it is a very nasty temper&mdash;can&rsquo;t you
      break through it, Sophy, and confess it all to your dear mamma? You would
      be so much better. But I know it is of no use, poor child, it is just like
      her father.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia was growing very angry, and it was well that Maurice&rsquo;s merry
      crowings were heard approaching. Miss Meadows was delighted to see him,
      but as he had a great aversion to her, the interview was not prolonged,
      since he could not be persuaded to keep the peace by being held up to
      watch a buzzing fly, as much out of sight of her as possible, wrinkling up
      his nose, and preparing to cry whenever he caught sight of her white
      bonnet and pink roses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Meadows bethought her that grandmamma was anxious, so she only waited
      to give an invitation to tea, but merely to Mrs. Kendal; she would say
      nothing about Sophy since disgrace&mdash;well-merited&mdash;if they could
      only see some feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; said Albinia, &lsquo;some evening perhaps I may come, since you are
      so kind, but I don&rsquo;t think I can leave this poor twisted arm to itself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Meadows evaporated in hopes that Sophy would be sensible of&mdash;and
      assurances that Mrs. Kendal was a great deal too&mdash;with finally,
      &lsquo;Good-bye, Sophy, I wish I could have told grandmamma that you had shown
      some feeling.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I believe,&rsquo; said Albinia, &lsquo;that you would only be too glad if you knew
      how.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia could not help feeling indignant at the misjudged persecution; and
      yet it seemed to render the poor child more entirely her own, since all
      the world besides had turned against her. &lsquo;Kiss her, Maurice,&rsquo; she said,
      holding the little fellow towards her. That scratched arm of hers has
      spared your small brains from more than you guess.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy&rsquo;s first impulse was to hide her face, but he thought it was bo-peep,
      caught hold of her fingers, and laughed; then came to a sudden surprised
      stop, and looked up to his mother, when the countenance behind the screen
      proved sad instead of laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! baby, you had better have done with me,&rsquo; Sophy said, bitterly; &lsquo;you
      are the only one that does not hate me yet, and you don&rsquo;t know what I have
      done to you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know some one else that cares for you, my poor Sophy,&rsquo; said Albinia,
      &lsquo;and who would do anything to make you feel it without distressing you. If
      you knew how I wish I knew what to do for you!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is no use,&rsquo; said Sophy, moodily; &lsquo;I was born to be a misery to myself
      and every one else.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What has put such a fancy in your head, my dear?&rsquo; said Albinia, nearly
      smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Grandmamma&rsquo;s Betty said so, she used to call me Peter Grievous, and I
      know it is so. It is of no good to bother yourself about me. It can&rsquo;t be
      helped, and there&rsquo;s an end of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is not an end of it, indeed!&rsquo; cried Albinia. &lsquo;Why, Sophy, do you
      suppose I could bear to leave you so?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t see why not.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why not?&rsquo; continued Albinia, in her bright, tender voice. &lsquo;Why, because I
      must love you with all my heart. You are your own dear papa&rsquo;s child, and
      this little man&rsquo;s sister. Yes, and you are yourself, my poor, sad, lonely
      child, who does not know how to bring out the thoughts that prey on her,
      and who thinks it very hard to have a stranger instead of her own mother.
      I know I should have felt so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I have behaved so ill to you,&rsquo; cried Sophy, as if bent on repelling
      the proffered affection. &lsquo;I would not like you, and I did not like you.
      Never! and I have gone against you every way I could.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And now I love you because you are sorry for it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not&rsquo;&mdash;Sophy had begun, but the words turned into &lsquo;Am I?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think you are,&rsquo; and with the sweetest of tearful smiles, she put an arm
      round the no longer resisting Sophy, and laying her cheek against the
      little brother&rsquo;s, she kissed first one and then the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t think why you are so,&rsquo; said Sophy, still struggling against the
      undeserved love, though far more feebly. &lsquo;I shall never deserve it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;See if you don&rsquo;t, when we pull together instead of contrary ways.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But,&rsquo; cried Sophy, with a sudden start from her, as if remembering a
      mortal offence, &lsquo;you drained the pond!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I own I earnestly wished it to be drained; but had you any reason for
      regretting it, my dear?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! you did not know,&rsquo; said Sophy. &lsquo;He and I used to be always there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&mdash;?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, will you make me say it?&rsquo; cried Sophy. &lsquo;Edmund! I mean Edmund! We
      always called it his pond. He made the little quay for his boats&mdash;he
      used to catch the minnows there. I could go and stand by it, and think he
      was coming out to play; and now you have had it dried up, and his dear
      little minnows are all dead,&rsquo; and she burst into a passion of tears, that
      made Maurice cry till Albinia hastily carried him off and returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear, I am sorry it seemed so unkind. I do not think we could have let
      the pond stay, for it was making the house unhealthy; but if we had talked
      over it together, it need not have appeared so very cruel and spiteful.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you are spiteful,&rsquo; said Sophy, &lsquo;though I sometimes think
      so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The filial compliment was highly gratifying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And now, Sophy,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;that I have told you why we were obliged to
      have the pond drained, will you tell me what you wanted with baby at Mrs.
      Osborn&rsquo;s?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will tell,&rsquo; said Sophy, &lsquo;but you wont like it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I like anything better than concealment.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mrs. Osborn said she never saw him. She said you kept him close, and that
      nobody was good enough to touch him; so I promised I would bring him over,
      and I kept my word. I know it was wrong&mdash;and&mdash;I did not think
      you would ever forgive me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But how could you do it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mrs. Osborn and all used to be so kind to us when there was nobody else.
      I wont cast them off because we are too fine and grand for them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never thought of that. I only was afraid of your getting into silly
      ways, and your papa did not wish us to be intimate there. And now you see
      he was right, for good friends would not have led you to such disobedience&mdash;and
      by stealth, too, what I should have thought you would most have hated.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia had been far from intending these last words to have been taken as
      they were. Sophy hid her face, and cried piteously with an utter
      self-abandonment of grief, that Albinia could scarcely understand; but at
      last she extracted some broken words. &lsquo;False! shabby! yes&mdash;Oh! I have
      been false! Oh! Edmund! Edmund! Edmund! the only thing I thought I still
      was! I thought I was true! Oh, by stealth! Why couldn&rsquo;t I die when I
      tried, when Edmund did?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And has life been a blank ever since?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Off and on,&rsquo; said Sophy. &lsquo;Well, why not? I am sure papa is melancholy
      enough. I don&rsquo;t like people that are always making fun, I can&rsquo;t see any
      sense in it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Some sorts of merriment are sad, and hollow, and wrong, indeed,&rsquo; said
      Albinia, &lsquo;but not all, I hope. You know there is so much love and mercy
      all round us, that it is unthankful not to have a cheerful spirit. I wish
      I could give you one, Sophy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy shook her head. &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t understand about mercy and love, when
      Edmund was all I cared for.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But, Sophy, if life is so sad and hard to you, don&rsquo;t you see the mercy
      that took Edmund away to perfect joy? Remember, not cutting you off from
      him, but keeping him safe for you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; cried Sophy, &lsquo;I have never been good since he went. I have got
      worse and worse, but I did think I was true still, that that one thing was
      left me&mdash;but now&mdash;&rsquo; The sense of having acted a deception seemed
      to produce grief under which the stubborn pride was melting away, and it
      was most affecting to see the child weeping over the lost jewel of truth,
      which she seemed to feel the last link with the remarkable boy whose
      impress had been left so strongly on all connected with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear, the truth is in you still, or you could not grieve thus over
      your failure,&rsquo; said Albinia. &lsquo;I know you erred, because it did not occur
      to you that it was not acting openly by me; but oh! Sophy, there is
      something that would bring you nearer to Edmund than hard truth in your
      own strength.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean,&rsquo; said Sophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did you ever think what Edmund is about now?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; said Sophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I only know that the one thing which is carried with us to the other
      world is love, Sophy, and love that becomes greater than we can yet
      imagine. If you would think of Him who redeemed and saved your dear
      Edmund, and who is his happiness, his exceeding great reward, your heart
      would warm, and, oh! what hope and peace would come!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Edmund was good,&rsquo; said Sophy, in a tone as if to mark the hopeless gulf
      between.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you are sorry. All human goodness begins from sorrow. It had even to
      be promised first for baby at his christening, you know. Oh, Sophy, God&rsquo;s
      blessing can make all these tears come to joy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia&rsquo;s own tears were flowing so fast, that she broke off to hide them
      in her own room, her heart panting with hope, and yet with grief and pity
      for the piteous disclosure of so dreary a girlhood. After all, childhood,
      if not the happiest, is the saddest period of life&mdash;pains, griefs,
      petty tyrannies, neglects, and terrors have not the alleviation of the
      experience that &lsquo;this also shall pass away;&rsquo; time moves with a tardier
      pace, and in the narrower sphere of interests, there is less to distract
      the attention from the load of grievances. Hereditary low spirits, a
      precocious mind, a reserved temper, a motherless home, the loss of her
      only congenial companion, and the long-enduring effect of her illness upon
      her health, had all conspired to weigh down the poor girl, and bring on an
      almost morbid state of gloomy discontent. Her father&rsquo;s second marriage, by
      enlivening the house, had rendered her peculiarities even more painful to
      herself and others, and the cultivation of mind that was forced upon her,
      made her more averse to the trifling and playfulness, which, while she was
      younger, had sometimes brightened and softened her. And this was the girl
      whom her father had resolved upon sending to the selfish, inconsiderate,
      frivolous world of school-girls, just when the first opening had been
      made, the first real insight gained into her feelings, the first
      appearance of having touched her heart! Albinia felt baffled,
      disappointed, almost despairing. His stern decree, once made, was, she
      knew, well-nigh unalterable; and though resolved to use her utmost
      influence, she doubted its power after having seen that look of decision.
      Nay, she tried to think he might be right. There might be those who would
      manage Sophy better. Eighteen months had been a fair trial, and she had
      failed. She prayed earnestly for whatever might be best for the child, and
      for herself, that she might take it patiently and submissively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy felt the heat of the day a good deal, but towards the evening she
      revived, and seemed so much cheered and refreshed by her tea, that, as the
      sound of the church bell came sweetly down in the soft air, Albinia said,
      &lsquo;Sophy, I am going to take advantage of my holiday and go to the evening
      service. I suppose you had rather not come?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think I will,&rsquo; returned Sophy, somewhat glumly, but Albinia hailed the
      answer joyfully, as the first shamefaced effort of a reserved character
      wishing to make a new beginning, and she took care that no remark, not
      even a look, should rouse the sullen sensitiveness that could so easily be
      driven back for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly they crept up the steps on the shady side of the hill, watching
      how, beyond the long shadow it cast over the town and the meadows, the
      trees revelled in the sunset light, and windows glittered like great
      diamonds, where in the ordinary daylight the distance was too great for
      distinct vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      The church was cool and quiet, and there was something in Sophy&rsquo;s
      countenance and reverent attitude that seemed as if she were consecrating
      a newly-formed resolution; her eye was often raised, as though in spite of
      herself, to the name of the brother whose short life seemed inseparably
      interwoven with all the higher aspirations of his home.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of the Thanksgiving, a sudden movement attracted Albinia, and
      she saw Sophy resting her head, and looking excessively pale. She put her
      arm round her, and would have led her out, but could not persuade her to
      move, and by the time the Blessing was given, the power was gone, and she
      had almost fainted away, when a tall strong form stooped over her, and Mr.
      Dusautoy gathered her up in his arms, and bore her off as if she had been
      a baby, to the open window of his own drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Put me down! The floor, please!&rsquo; said Sophy, feebly, for all her
      remaining faculties were absorbed in dislike to the mode of conveyance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, flat on the floor,&rsquo; said Mrs. Dusautoy, rising with full energy, and
      laying a cushion under Sophy&rsquo;s head, reaching a scent-bottle, and sending
      her husband for cold water and sal volatile; with readiness that
      astonished Albinia, unused to illness, and especially to faintings, and
      remorseful at having taken Sophy out. &lsquo;Was it the pain of her arm that had
      overcome her?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Sophy, &lsquo;it was only my back.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed! you never told me you had hurt your back;&rsquo; and Albinia began
      describing the fall, and declaring there must be a sprain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, no,&rsquo; said Sophy, &lsquo;kneeling always does it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Does what, my dear?&rsquo; said Albinia, sitting on the floor by her, and
      looking up to Mrs. Dusautoy, exceedingly frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Makes me feel sick,&rsquo; said Sophy; &lsquo;I thought it would go off, as it always
      does, it didn&rsquo;t; but it is better now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, don&rsquo;t get up yet,&rsquo; said Mrs. Dusautoy, as she was trying to move; &lsquo;I
      would offer you the sofa, it would be more hospitable, but I think the
      floor is the most comfortable place.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you, <i>much</i>,&rsquo; said Sophy, with an emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you ever lie down on it when you are tired?&rsquo; asked the lady, looking
      anxiously at Sophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I always wish I might.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia was surprised at the interrogations that followed; she did not
      understand what Mrs. Dusautoy was aiming at, in the close questioning,
      which to her amazement did not seem to offend, but rather to be gratifying
      by the curious divination of all sensations. It made Albinia feel as if
      she had been carrying on a deliberate system of torture, when she heard of
      a pain in the back, hardly ever ceasing, aggravated by sitting upright,
      growing severe with the least fatigue, and unless favoured by day,
      becoming so bad at night as to take away many hours of sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! Sophy, Sophy,&rsquo; she cried, with tears in her eyes, &lsquo;how could you go
      on so? Why did you never tell me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I did not like,&rsquo; began Sophy, &lsquo;I was used to it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, that barrier! Albinia was in uncontrollable distress, that the girl
      should have chosen to undergo so much suffering rather than bestow any
      confidence. Sophy stole her hand into hers, and said in her odd, short
      way, &lsquo;Never mind, it did not signify.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Mrs. Dusautoy, &lsquo;those things are just what one does get so
      much used to, that it seems much easier to bear them than to speak about
      them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But to let oneself be so driven about,&rsquo; cried Albinia. &lsquo;Oh! Sophy, you
      will never do so again! If I had ever guessed&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Please hush! Never mind!&rsquo; said Sophy, almost crossly, and getting up from
      the floor quickly, as though resolved to be well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have never minded long enough,&rsquo; sighed Albinia. &lsquo;What shall I do, Mrs.
      Dusautoy? What do you think it is?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the last question Mrs. Dusautoy wished to be asked in Sophy&rsquo;s
      presence. She had little doubt that it was spine complaint like her own,
      but she had not intended to let her perceive the impression, till after
      having seen Mrs. Kendal alone. However, Albinia&rsquo;s impetuosity disconcerted
      all precautions, and Sophy&rsquo;s two great black eyes were rounded with
      suppressed terror, as if expecting her doom. &lsquo;I think that a doctor ought
      to answer that question,&rsquo; Mrs. Dusautoy began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, yes,&rsquo; exclaimed Albinia, &lsquo;but I never had any faith in old Mr.
      Bowles, I had rather go to a thorough good man at once.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, certainly, by all means.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And then to whom! I will write to my Aunt Mary. It seems exactly like
      you. Do you think it is the spine?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am afraid so. But, my dear,&rsquo; holding out her hand caressingly to Sophy,
      &lsquo;you need not be frightened&mdash;you need not look at me as an example of
      what you will come to&mdash;I am only an example of what comes of never
      speaking of one&rsquo;s ailments.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And of having no mother to find them out!&rsquo; cried Albinia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed,&rsquo; said Mrs. Dusautoy, anxious to console and encourage, as well as
      to talk the young step-mother out of her self-reproach, &lsquo;I do not think
      that if I had been my good aunt&rsquo;s own child, she would have been more
      likely to find out that anything was amiss. It was the fashion to be
      strong and healthy in that house, and I was never really ill&mdash;but I
      came as a little stunted, dwining cockney, and so I was considered ever
      after&mdash;never quite comfortable, often forgetting myself in enjoyment,
      paying for it afterwards, but quite used to it. We all thought it was
      &ldquo;only Fanny,&rdquo; and part of my London breeding. Yes, we thought so in good
      faith, even after the largest half of my life had been spent in
      Yorkshire.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what brought it to a crisis? Did they go on neglecting you?&rsquo; 
      exclaimed Albinia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, my dear,&rsquo; said the little lady, a glow lighting on her cheek, and a
      smile awakening, &lsquo;my uncle took a new curate, whom it was the family
      custom to call &ldquo;the good-natured giant,&rdquo; and whose approach put all of us
      young ladies in a state of great excitement. It was all in character with
      his good-nature, you know, to think of dragging the poor little shrimp up
      the hill to church, and I believe he did not know how she would get on
      without his strong arm; for do you know, when he had the curacy of
      Lauriston given him, he chose to carry the starveling off with him,
      instead of any of those fine, handsome prosperous girls. Dear Mary and
      Bessie! how good they were, and how kind and proud for me! I never could
      complain of not having sisters.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, and Mr. Dusautoy made you have advice?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not he! Why, we all believed it cockneyism, you know, and besides, I was
      so happy and so well, that when we went to Scotland, I fairly walked
      myself off my legs, and ended the honeymoon laid up in a little inn on
      Loch Katrine, where John used regularly to knock his head whenever he came
      into the room. It was a fortnight before I could get to Edinburgh, and the
      journey made me as bad as ever. So the doctors were called in, and poor
      John learnt what a crooked stick he had chosen; but they all said that if
      I had been taken in hand as a child, most likely I should have been a
      sound woman. The worst of it was, that I was so thoroughly knocked up that
      I could not bear the motion of a carriage; besides, I suppose the doctors
      wanted a little amusement out of me, for they would not hear of my going
      home. So poor John had to go to Lauriston by himself, and those were the
      longest, dreariest six months I ever spent in my life, though Bessie was
      so good as to come and take care of me. But at last, when I had nearly
      made up my mind to defy the whole doctorhood, they gave leave, and between
      water and steam, John brought me to Lauriston, and ever since that, I
      don&rsquo;t see that a backbone would have made us a bit happier.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy had been intently reading Mrs. Dusautoy&rsquo;s face all through the
      narration, from under her thick black eyelashes, and at the end she drew a
      sigh of relief, and seemed to catch the smile of glad gratitude and
      affection. There was a precedent, which afforded incredible food to the
      tumultuous cravings of a heart that had been sinking in sullen gloom under
      the consciousness of an unpleasing exterior. The possibility of a
      &lsquo;good-natured giant&rsquo; was far more present to her mind than the present
      probability of future suffering and restraint.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ever rapid and eager, Albinia could think of nothing but immediate
      measures for Sophy&rsquo;s good, and the satisfaction of her own conscience. She
      could not bear even to wait for Mr. Kendal&rsquo;s return, but, as her aunts
      were still in London, she resolved on carrying Sophy to their house on the
      following day for the best advice. It was already late, and she knelt at
      the table to dash off two notes to put into the post-office as she went
      home. One to Mrs. Annesley, to announce her coming with Sophy, baby, and
      Susan, the other as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;July 10th, 9 p.m.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dearest Edmund,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I find I have been cruelly neglectful. I have hunted and driven that poor
      child about till it has brought on spine complaint. The only thing I can
      do, is to take her to have the best advice without loss of time, so I am
      going to-morrow to my aunt&rsquo;s. It would take too long to write and ask your
      leave. You must forgive this, as indeed each word I have to say is,
      forgive! She is so generous and kind! You know I meant to do my best, but
      they were right, I was too young.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                                            &lsquo;Forgive yours,
                                                        &lsquo;A. K.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      The Dusautoys were somewhat taken by surprise, but they knew too well the
      need of promptitude to dissuade her; and Sophia herself sat aghast at the
      commotion, excited by the habitual discomfort of which she had thought so
      little. The vicar, when he found Mrs. Kendal in earnest, offered to go
      with them and protect them; but Albinia was a veteran in independent
      railway travelling, and was rather affronted by being treated as a
      helpless female. Mrs. Dusautoy, better aware of what the journey might be
      to one at least of the travellers, gave advice, and lent air cushions, and
      Albinia bade her good night with an almost sobbing &lsquo;thank you,&rsquo; and an
      entreaty that if Mr. Kendal came home before them, she would tell him all
      about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      At home, she instantly sent the stupefied Sophy to bed, astonished the
      little nurse, ordered down boxes and bags, and spent half the night in
      packing, glad to be stirring and to tire herself into sleeping, for her
      remorse and her anticipations were so painful, that, but for fatigue, her
      bed would have been no resting-place.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Winifred Ferrars was surprised by Mr. Kendal&rsquo;s walking into her garden,
      with a perturbed countenance, begging her to help him to make out what
      could be the meaning of a note which he had just received. He was afraid
      that there was much amiss with the baby, and heartily wished that he had
      not been persuaded to leave home; but poor Albinia wrote in so much
      distress, that he could not understand her letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      More accustomed to Albinia&rsquo;s epistolary habits, Winifred exclaimed at the
      first glance, &lsquo;What can you mean? There is not one word of the little one!
      It is only Sophy!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The immediate clearing of his face was not complimentary to poor Sophy, as
      he said, &lsquo;Can you be quite sure? I had begun to hope that Albinia might at
      least have the comfort of seeing this little fellow healthy; but let me
      see&mdash;she says nursed and&mdash;and danced&mdash;is it? this poor
      child&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no; it is hunted and driven; that&rsquo;s the way she always <i>will</i>
      make her <i>h</i>&rsquo;s; besides, what nonsense the other would be.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This poor child&mdash;&rsquo; repeated Mr. Kendal, &lsquo;Going up to London for
      advice. She would hardly do that with Sophia.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who ever heard of a baby of six months old having a spine complaint?&rsquo; 
      cried Mrs. Ferrars almost angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have lost one in that way,&rsquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      A dead silence ensued, till Winifred, to her great relief, spied the
      feminine pronoun, but could not fully satisfy Mr. Kendal that the ups and
      downs were insufficient for the word <i>him</i>; and each scrawl was
      discussed as though it had been a cuneiform inscription, until he had been
      nearly argued into believing in the lesser evil. He then was persuaded
      that the Meadowses had been harassing and frightening Albinia into this
      startling measure. It was so contrary to his own nature, that he hardly
      believed that it had actually taken place, and that she must be in London
      by this time, but at any rate, he must join her there, and know the worst.
      He would take the whole party to an hotel, if it were too great a liberty
      to quarter themselves upon Mrs. Annesley.
    </p>
    <p>
      Winifred was as much surprised as if the chess-king had taken a knight&rsquo;s
      move, but she encouraged his resolution, assured him of a welcome at what
      the cousinhood were wont to call the Family Office, and undertook the
      charge of Gilbert and Lucy. The sorrowful, almost supplicating tone of his
      wife&rsquo;s letter, would have sufficed to bring him to her, even without his
      disquietude for his child, whichever of them it might be; and though
      Albinia&rsquo;s merry blue-eyed boy had brought a renewed spring of hope and
      life, his crashed spirits trembled at the least alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, though the cheerful Winifred had convinced his reason, his gloomy
      anticipations revived before he reached London; and with the stern
      composure of one accustomed to bend to the heaviest blows, he knocked at
      Mrs. Annesley&rsquo;s door. He was told that Mrs. Kendal was out; but on further
      inquiry, learnt that Sophy was in the drawing-room, where he found her
      curled up in the corner of the sofa, reading intently.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sprang to her feet with a cry of surprise, but did not approach,
      though he held out his arms, saying in a voice husky with anxiety, &lsquo;Is the
      baby well, Sophia?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; she cried, &lsquo;quite well; he is out in the carriage with them.&rsquo; Then
      shrinking as he was stooping to kiss her, she reddened, reddening deeply,
      &lsquo;Papa, I did very wrong; I was sly and disobedient, and I might have
      killed him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do not let us speak of that now, my dear, I want to hear of&mdash;&rsquo; and
      again he would have drawn her into his embrace, but she held out her hand,
      with her repelling gesture, and burst forth in her rude honesty, &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t
      be forgiven only because I am ill. Hear all about it, papa, and then say
      you forgive me if you can. I always was cross to mamma, because I was
      determined I would be; and I did not think she had any business with us.
      The more she was kind, the more I did not like it; and I thought it was
      mean in Gilbert and Lucy to be fond of her. No! I have not done yet! I
      grew naughtier and naughtier, till at last I have been false and sly, and&mdash;have
      done this to baby&mdash;and I would not have cared then&mdash;if&mdash;if
      she would not have been&mdash;oh! so good!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy made no farther resistance to the arm that was thrown round her, as
      her father said, &lsquo;So good, that she has overcome evil with good. My child,
      how should I not forgive when you are sensible of your mistake, and when
      she has so freely forgiven?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy did not speak, but she pressed his arm closer round her, and laid
      her cheek gratefully on his shoulder. She only wished it could last for
      ever; but he soon lifted her, that he might look anxiously at her face,
      while he said, &lsquo;And what is all this, my dear! I am afraid you are not
      well.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her energies were recalled; and, squeezing his hand, she said, &lsquo;Mind, you
      will not let them say it was mamma&rsquo;s fault.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who is accusing her, my dear?&rsquo; What is the matter?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is only my back,&rsquo; said Sophy; &lsquo;there always was a stupid pain there;
      but grandmamma&rsquo;s Betty said I made a fuss, and that it was all laziness,
      and I would not let any one say so again, and I never told of it, and it
      went on till the other night I grew faint at church, and Mrs. Dusautoy put
      mamma in such a fright, that we all came here yesterday; and there came a
      doctor this morning, who says my spine is not straight, and that I must
      lie on my back for a long time; but never mind, papa, it will be very
      comfortable to lie still and read, and I shall not be cross now,&rsquo; she
      added reassuringly, as his grasp pressed her close, with a start of
      dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear, I am afraid you hardly know what you may have to go through, but
      I am glad you meet it bravely.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you wont let them say mamma did it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who should say so?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aunt Maria will, and mamma <i>will</i> go and say so herself,&rsquo; cried
      Sophy; &lsquo;she <i>will</i> say it was taking walks and carrying baby, and
      it&rsquo;s not true. I told the doctor how my back ached long before baby came
      or she either, and he said that most likely the weakness had been left by
      the fever. So if it is any one&rsquo;s mismanagement, it is Aunt Maria&rsquo;s, and if
      you wont tell her so, I will.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gently, Sophy, that would hardly be grateful, after the pains that she
      has taken with you, and the care she meant to give.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Her care was all worry,&rsquo; said Sophy, &lsquo;and it will be very lucky if I
      don&rsquo;t tell her so, if she says her provoking things to mamma. But you wont
      believe them, papa.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Most certainly not.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, you must tell her to be happy again,&rsquo; continued Sophy; &lsquo;I cannot
      bear to see her looking sorrowful! Last night, when she fancied me asleep,
      she cried&mdash;oh! till it made me miserable! And to-day I heard Miss
      Ferrars say to Mrs. Annesley, that her fine spirits were quite gone. You
      know it is very silly, for I am the last person in all the world she ought
      to cry for.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She has an infinite treasure of love,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal, &lsquo;and we have done
      very little that we should be blessed with it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There, they are come home!&rsquo; exclaimed Sophy, starting up as sounds were
      heard on the stairs, and almost at the same moment Albinia was in the
      room, overflowing with contrition, gladness, and anxiety; but something of
      sweetness in the first hasty greeting made the trust overcome all the
      rest; and, understanding his uppermost wish, she stepped back to the
      staircase, and in another second had put Maurice into his arms, blooming
      and contented, and with a wide-mouthed smile for his papa. Mr. Kendal held
      him fondly through all the hospitable welcomes of the aunts, and his own
      explanations; but to Albinia it was all confusion, and almost annoyance,
      till she could take him upstairs, and tell her own story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am afraid you have been very much alarmed,&rsquo; were his first words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have done everything wrong from beginning to end,&rsquo; said Albinia. &lsquo;Oh,
      Edmund, I am so glad you are come! Now you will see the doctor, and know
      whether it was as bad as all the rest to bring her to London.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dearest, you must calm yourself, and try to explain. You know I
      understand nothing yet, except from your resolute little advocate
      downstairs, and your own note, which I could scarcely make out, except
      that you were in great trouble.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, that note; I wrote it in one of my impetuous fits. Maurice used to
      say I ran frantic, and grew irrational, and so I did not know what I was
      saying to you; and I brought that poor patient girl up here in all the
      heat, and the journey hurt her so much, that I don&rsquo;t know how we shall
      ever get her home again. Oh, Edmund, I am the worst wife and mother in the
      world; and I undertook it all with such foolish confidence.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kendal liked her impetuous fits as little as her brother did, and was
      not so much used to them; but he dealt with her in his quiet,
      straightforward way. &lsquo;You are exaggerating now, Albinia, and I do not
      wonder at it, for you have had a great deal to startle and to try you.
      Walking up and down is only heating and agitating you more; sit down here,
      and let me hear what gave you this alarm.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The grave affection of his manner restrained her, and his presence soothed
      the flutter of spirits; though she still devoted herself with a sort of
      wilfulness to bear all the blame, until he said, &lsquo;This is foolish,
      Albinia; it is of no use to look at anything but the simple truth. This
      affection of the spine must be constitutional, and if neglect have
      aggravated the evil, it must date from a much earlier period than since
      she has been under your charge. If any one be to blame, it is myself, for
      the apathy that prevented me from placing the poor things under proper
      care, but I was hardly then aware that Maria&rsquo;s solicitude is always in the
      wrong place.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But everybody declares that it was always visible, and that no one could
      look at her without seeing that she was crooked.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Apres le coup,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal. &lsquo;I grant you that a person of more
      experience might perhaps have detected what was amiss sooner than you did,
      but you have only to regret the ignorance you shared with us all; and you
      did your utmost according to your judgment.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And a cruel utmost it was,&rsquo; said Albinia; &lsquo;it is frightful to think what
      I inflicted, and she endured in silence, because I had not treated her so
      that she could bear to speak to me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is over now,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal, &lsquo;you have conquered her at last.
      Pride could not hold out against such sweetness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is her generosity,&rsquo; said Albinia; &lsquo;I always knew she was the best of
      them all, if one could but get at her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What have you done to her? I never heard her say half so much as she
      voluntarily said to me just now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor dear! I believe the key of her heart was lost when Edmund died, and
      so all within was starved,&rsquo; said Albinia. &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; as his eyes were suddenly
      raised and fixed on her, &lsquo;I got to that at last. No one has ever
      understood her, since she lost her brother.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She has a certain likeness to him. I knew she was his favourite sister;
      but such a child as she was&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Children have deeper souls than you give them credit for,&rsquo; said Albinia.
      &lsquo;Yes, Edmund, you and Sophy are very much alike! You had your study, and
      poor Sophy enclosed herself in a perpetual cocoon of study atmosphere, and
      so you never found each other out till to-day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps it was the influence of the frantic fit that caused her to make so
      direct a thrust; but Mr. Kendal was not offended. There was a good deal in
      the mere absence from habitual scenes and associations; he always left a
      great deal of reserve behind him at Bayford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You may be right, Albinia,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;I sometimes think that amongst us
      you are like the old poet&rsquo;s &ldquo;star confined into a tomb.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Such a compliment was a pretty reward for her temerity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Returning to business, she found that her journey was treated as more
      judicious than she deserved. The consequences had justified her decision.
      Mr. Kendal knew it was the right thing to be done, and was glad to have
      been spared the dreadful task of making up his mind to it. He sat down of
      his own accord to write a note to Winifred, beginning, &lsquo;Albinia was right,
      as she always is,&rsquo; and though his wife interlined, &lsquo;Albinia had no right
      to be right, for she was inconsiderate, as she always is,&rsquo; she looked so
      brilliantly pretty and bright, and was so full of sunny liveliness, that
      she occasioned one of the very few disputes between her good aunts. Miss
      Ferrars declared that poor Albinia was quite revived by the return to her
      old home, and absence of care, while Mrs. Annesley insisted on giving the
      credit to Mr. Kendal. They were perfectly agreed in unwillingness to part
      with their guests; and as the doctor wished to see more of his patient,
      the visit was prolonged, to the enjoyment of all parties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy had received her sentence so easily, that it was suspected that she
      did not realize the tedium of confinement, and was relieved by being
      allowed to be inactive. Until she should go home, she might do whatever
      did not fatigue her; but most sights, and even the motion of the carriage,
      were so fatiguing, that she was much more inclined to remain at home and
      revel in the delightful world of books. The kind, unobtrusive petting; the
      absence of customary irritations; the quiet high-bred tone of the family,
      so acted upon her, as to render her something as agreeably new to herself
      as to other people. The glum mask was cast aside, she responded amiably to
      kindness and attention, allowed herself to be drawn into conversation, and
      developed much more intelligence and depth than even Albinia had given her
      credit for.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, when Miss Ferrars was showing Mr. Kendal some illustrations of
      Indian scenery, a question arose upon the date of the native sovereign to
      whom the buildings were ascribed. Mr. Kendal could not recollect; but
      Sophia, looking up, quietly pronounced the date, and gave her reasons for
      it. Miss Ferrars asked how she could have learnt so much on an
      out-of-the-way topic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I read a book of the History of India, up in the loft,&rsquo; said Sophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That book!&rsquo; exclaimed her father; &lsquo;I wish you joy! I never could get
      through it! It is the driest chronicle I ever read&mdash;a mere book of
      reference. What could induce you to read that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I would read anything about India;&rsquo; and her tone, though low and subdued,
      betrayed such enthusiasm as could find nothing dry, and this in a girl who
      had read aloud the reign of Edward III. with stolid indifference!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I think I can promise you more interesting reading about India when
      we go home,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colour rose on Sophy&rsquo;s cheek. Books out of papa&rsquo;s study! Could the
      world offer a greater privilege?&rsquo; She could scarcely pronounce, &lsquo;Thank
      you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very faithful to her birth-place,&rsquo; said Miss Ferrars; &lsquo;but she must have
      been very young when she came home.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;About five years old, I believe,&rsquo; said her father. &lsquo;You surely can
      remember nothing of Talloon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; said Sophy, mournfully; &lsquo;I used&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thought Indian children usually lost their eastern recollections very
      early,&rsquo; said Miss Ferrars; &lsquo;I never heard of one who could remember the
      sound of Hindostanee a year after coming home.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kendal, entertained and gratified, turned to his daughter; and, by way
      of experiment, began a short sentence in Hindostanee; but the first sound
      brought a glow to her cheeks, and, with a hurried gesture, she murmured,
      &lsquo;Please don&rsquo;t, papa.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia saw that feelings were here concerned which must not be played on
      in public; and she hastily plunged into the discussion, and drew it away
      from Sophy. Following her up-stairs at bed-time, she contrived to win from
      her an explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edmund had been seven years old at the time of the return to England.
      Fondly attached to some of the Hindoo servants, and with unusual
      intelligence and observation, the gorgeous scenery and oriental habits of
      his first home had dwelt vividly in his imagination, and he had always
      considered himself as only taken to England for a time, to return again to
      India. Thus, he had been fond of romancing of the past and of the future,
      and had never let his little sister&rsquo;s recollections fade entirely away.
      His father had likewise thought that it would save future trouble to keep
      up the boys&rsquo; knowledge of the language, which would by-and-by be so
      important to them. Gilbert&rsquo;s health had caused his studies to be often
      intermitted, but Edmund had constantly received instructions in the Indian
      languages, and whatever he learnt had been imparted to Sophia. It was
      piteous to discover how much time the poor forlorn little girl had spent
      sitting on the floor in the loft, poring over old grammars, and
      phrase-books, and translations of missionary or government school-books
      there accumulated&mdash;anything that related to India, or that seemed to
      carry on what she had done with Edmund: and she had acquired just enough
      to give her a keen appetite for all the higher class of lore, which she
      knew to reside in the unapproachable study. Those few familiar words from
      her father had overcome her, because, a trivial greeting in themselves,
      they had been a kind of password between her and her brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kendal was greatly touched, and very remorseful for having left such a
      heart to pine in solitude, while he was absorbed in his own lonely grief;
      and Albinia ventured to say, &lsquo;I believe the greatest pleasure you could
      give her would be to help her to keep up the language.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled, but said, &lsquo;Of what possible use could it be to her?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was not thinking of future use. It would be of immense present use to
      her to do anything with you, and I can see that nothing would gratify her
      so much. Besides, I have been trying to think of all the new things I
      could set her to do. She must have lessons to fill up the day, and I want
      to make fresh beginnings, and not go back to the blots and scars of our
      old misunderstandings.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You want me to teach her Sanscrit because you cannot teach her Italian.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Exactly so,&rsquo; said Albinia; &lsquo;and the Italian will spring all the better
      from the venerable root, when we have forgotten how cross we used to be to
      each other over our relative pronouns.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But there is hardly anything which I could let her read in those
      languages.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very likely not; but you can pick out what there is. Do you remember the
      fable of the treasure that was to be gained by digging under the
      apple-tree, and which turned out not to be gold, but the fruit, the
      consequence of digging? Now, I want you to dig Sophy; a Sanscrit, or a
      Hindostanee, or a Persian treasure will do equally well as a pretext. If
      she had announced a taste for the differential calculus, I should have
      said the same. Only dig her, as Maurice dug me apropos to Homer. I
      wouldn&rsquo;t bother you, only you see no one else could either do it, or be
      the same to Sophy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We will see how it is,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal.
    </p>
    <p>
      With which Albinia was obliged to be content; but in the meantime she saw
      the two making daily progress in intimacy, and Mr. Kendal beginning to
      take a pride in his daughter&rsquo;s understanding and information, which he
      ascribed to Albinia, in spite of all her disclaimers. It was as if she had
      evoked the spirit of his lost son, which had lain hidden under the sullen
      demeanour of the girl, devoid indeed of many of Edmund&rsquo;s charms, but yet
      with the same sterling qualities, and with resemblance enough to afford
      infinite and unexpected joy and compensation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kendal enjoyed his stay in town. He visited libraries, saw pictures,
      and heard music, with the new zest of having a wife able to enter into his
      tastes. He met old friends, and did not shrink immoderately from those of
      his wife; nay, he found them extremely agreeable, and was pleased to see
      Albinia welcomed. Indeed, his sojourn in her former sphere served to make
      him wonder that she could be contented with Bayford, and to find her, of
      the whole party, by far the most ready to return home. Both he himself and
      Sophy had an unavowed dread of the influence of Willow Lawn; but Albinia
      had a spring of spirits, independent of place, and though happy, was
      craving for her duties, anxious to have the journey over, and afraid that
      London was making her little Maurice pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Meadows was the first person whom they saw at Willow Lawn. Two
      letters had passed, both so conventionally civil, that her state of mind
      could not be gathered from them, but her first tones proved that coherence
      was more than ever wanting, and no one attempted to understand anything
      she said, while she enfolded Sophy in an agitated embrace, and marshalled
      them to the drawing-room, where the chief of the apologies were spent upon
      Sophy&rsquo;s new couch, which had been sent down the day before by the
      luggage-train, and which she and Eweretta had attempted to put together in
      an impossible way, failing which, they had called in the carpenter, who
      had made it worse.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an untold advantage that she had to take the initiative in excuses.
      Sophy was so meek with weariness, that she took pretty well all the kind
      fidgeting that could not be averted from her, and Miss Meadows&rsquo;s discourse
      chiefly tended to assurances that Mrs. Kendal was right, and grandmamma
      was nervous&mdash;and poor Mr. Bowles&mdash;it could not be expected&mdash;with
      hints of the wonderful commotion the sudden flight to London had excited
      at Bayford. As soon as Mr. Kendal quitted the room, these hints were
      converted into something between expostulation, condolence, and
      congratulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was so very fortunate&mdash;so very lucky that dear Mr. Kendal had come
      home with her, for&mdash;she had said she would let Mrs. Kendal hear, if
      only that she might be on her guard&mdash;people were so ill-natured&mdash;there
      never was such a place for gossip&mdash;not that she heard it from any one
      but Mrs. Drury, who really now had driven in&mdash;not that she believed
      it, but to ascertain.&mdash;For Mrs. Drury had been told&mdash;mentioning
      no names&mdash;oh, no! for fear of making mischief&mdash;she had been told
      that Mrs. Kendal had actually been into Mr. Kendal&rsquo;s study, which was
      always kept locked up, and there she had found something which had
      distressed her so much that she had gone to Mr. Dusautoy, and by his
      advice had fled from home to the protection of her brother in Canada.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Without waiting for Bluebeard&rsquo;s asking for the key! Oh, Maria!&rsquo; cried
      Albinia, in a fit of laughter, while Sophia sat up on the sofa in
      speechless indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You may laugh, Mrs. Kendal, if you please,&rsquo; said Maria, with tart
      dignity; &lsquo;I have told you nothing but the truth. I should have thought for
      my part, but that&rsquo;s of no consequence, it was as well to be on one&rsquo;s guard
      in a nest of vipers, for Edmund&rsquo;s sake, if not for your own.&rsquo; And as this
      last speech convulsed Albinia, and rendered her incapable of reply, Miss
      Meadows became pathetic. &lsquo;I am sure the pains I have taken to trace out
      and contradict&mdash;and so nervous as grandmamma has been&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      sure, Mrs. Drury,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that though Edmund Kendal does lock his study
      door, nobody ever thought anything&mdash;the housemaids go in to clean it&mdash;and
      I&rsquo;ve been in myself when the whitewashers were about the house&mdash;I&rsquo;m
      sure Mrs. Kendal is a most amiable young woman, and you wouldn&rsquo;t raise
      reports.&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but Mrs. Osborn was positive that Mrs. Kendal
      was nearly an hour shut up alone in the study the night of Sophy&rsquo;s
      accident&mdash;and so sudden,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the carriage being sent for&mdash;not
      a servant knew of it&mdash;and then,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it was always the talk
      among the girls, that Mr. Kendal kept his study a forbidden place.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then,&rsquo; said Sophia, slowly, as she looked full at her aunt, &lsquo;it was the
      Osborns who dared to say such wicked things.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There now, I never meant you to be there. You ought to be gone to bed,
      child. It is not a thing for you to know anything about.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I only want to know whether it was the Osborns who invented these
      stories,&rsquo; said Sophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear,&rsquo; exclaimed Albinia, &lsquo;what can it signify? They are only a very
      good joke. I did not think there had been so much imagination in Bayford.&rsquo; 
      And off she went laughing again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They are very wicked,&rsquo; said Sophy, &lsquo;Aunt Maria, I will know if it was
      Mrs. Osborn who told the story.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy&rsquo;s <i>will</i> was too potent for Miss Meadows, and the admission was
      extracted in a burst of other odds and ends, in the midst of which Albinia
      beheld Sophy cross the room with a deliberate, determined step. Flying
      after her, she found her in the hall, wrapping herself up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sophy, what is this? What are you about?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let me alone,&rsquo; said Sophy, straining against her detaining hand, &lsquo;I do
      not know when I shall recover again, and I will go at once to tell the
      Osborns that I have done with them. I stuck to them because I thought they
      were my mother&rsquo;s friends; I did not guess that they would make an unworthy
      use of my friendship, and invent wicked stories of my father and you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Please don&rsquo;t make me laugh, Sophy, for I don&rsquo;t want to affront you. Yes,
      it is generous feeling; I don&rsquo;t wonder you are angry; but indeed silly
      nonsense like this is not worth it. It will die away of itself, it must be
      dead already, now they have seen we have not run away to Canada. Your
      heroics only make it more ridiculous.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I must tell Loo never to come here with her hypocrisy,&rsquo; repeated Sophy,
      standing still, but not yielding an inch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Meadows pursued them at the same moment with broken protestations
      that they must forget it, she never meant to make mischief, &amp;c., and
      the confusion was becoming worse confounded when Mr. Kendal emerged from
      the study, demanding what was the matter, to the great discomfiture of
      Maria, who began hushing Sophy, and making signs to Albinia that it would
      be dangerous for him to know anything about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Albinia was already exclaiming, &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s a champion wanting to do
      battle with Louisa Osborn in our cause. Oh, Edmund! our neighbours could
      find no way of accounting for my taking French leave, but by supposing
      that I took advantage of being shut in there, while poor little Maurice
      was squalling so furiously, to rifle your secrets, and detect something so
      shocking, that away I was fleeing to William in Canada.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Obliging,&rsquo; quietly said Mr. Kendal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, dear Edmund&mdash;I know&mdash;for my sake&mdash;for everything&rsquo;s
      sake, remember you are a family man, don&rsquo;t take any notice.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I certainly shall take no notice of such folly,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal, &lsquo;and I
      wish that no one else should. What are you about, Sophia?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tell mamma to let me go, papa,&rsquo; she exclaimed, &lsquo;I must and will tell
      Louisa that I hate her baseness and hypocrisy, and then I&rsquo;ll never speak
      to her again. Why will mamma laugh? It is very wicked of them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wrong in them, but laughing is the only way to treat it,&rsquo; said Mr.
      Kendal. &lsquo;Go back to your sofa and forget it. Your aunt and I have heard
      Bayford reports before.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy obeyed unwillingly, she was far too much incensed to forget. On her
      aunt&rsquo;s taking leave, and Mr. Kendal offering his escort up the hill, she
      rose up again, and would have perpetrated a denunciation by letter, had
      not Albinia seriously argued with her, and finding ridicule, expediency,
      and Christian forgiveness all fail of hitting the mark, said, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t
      know with what face you could attack Louisa, when you helped her to
      persecute poor Genevieve because you thought she had an instrument of
      torture in her drawer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was not I who said that,&rsquo; said Sophy, blushing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You took part with those who did. And poor Genevieve was a much more
      defenceless victim than papa or myself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I would not do so now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It does not take much individual blackness of heart to work up a fine
      promising slander. A surmise made in jest is repeated in earnest, and all
      the other tale-bearers think they are telling simple facts. Depend upon
      it, the story did not get off from the Osborns by any means as it came
      back to Aunt Maria.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should like to know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t let us make it any worse; and above all, do not let us tell Lucy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, no!&rsquo; said Sophy, emphatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Albinia&rsquo;s surprise no innuendo from Mrs. or Miss Meadows ever referred
      to her management having caused Sophy&rsquo;s misfortune, and she secretly
      attributed this silence to Mr. Kendal&rsquo;s having escorted his sister-in-law
      to her own house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy&rsquo;s chief abode became the morning-room, and she seemed very happy and
      tranquil there&mdash;shrinking from visitors, but grateful for the
      kindness of parents, brother and sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kendal, finding her really eager to learn of him, began teaching her
      Persian, and was astonished at her promptness and intelligence. He took
      increasing pleasure in her company, gave her books to read, and would
      sometimes tell the others not to stay at home for her sake, as he should
      be &lsquo;about the house.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He really gave up much time to her, and used to carry her, when the
      weather served, to a couch in the garden, for she could not bear the
      motion of wheels, and was forbidden to attempt walking, though she was to
      be in the air as much as possible, so that Albinia spent more time at
      home. The charge of Sophy was evidently her business, and after talking
      the matter over with Mrs. Dusautoy, she resigned, though not without a
      pang, the offices she had undertaken in the time of her superfluous
      activity, and limited herself to occasional superintendence, instead of
      undertaking constant employment in the parish. Though she felt grieved and
      humiliated, Willow Lawn throve the better for it, and so did her own mind,
      yes, and even her temper, which was far less often driven by over-haste
      into quick censure, or unconsidered reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mistakes about Sophia had been a lesson against one-sided government.
      At first, running into the other extreme, she was ready to imagine that
      all the past ill-humour had been the effect of her neglect and cruelty;
      and Sophy&rsquo;s amiability almost warranted the notion. The poor girl herself
      had promised &lsquo;never to be cross again,&rsquo; and fancied all temptation was
      over, since she had &lsquo;found out mamma,&rsquo; and papa was so kind to her. But
      all on a sudden, down came the cloud again. Nobody could detect any
      reason. Affronts abounded&mdash;not received with an explosion that would
      have been combated, laughed at, and disposed of, but treated with silence,
      and each sinking down to be added to the weight of cruel injuries. There
      was no complaint; Sophy obeyed all orders with her old form of dismal
      submission, but everything proposed to her was distasteful, and her
      answers were in the ancient surly style. If attempts were made to probe
      the malady, her reserve was impenetrable&mdash;nothing was the matter, she
      wanted nothing, was vexed at nothing. She pursued her usual occupations,
      but as if they were hardships; she was sullen towards her mamma,
      snappishly brief with her aunt and sister, and so ungracious and
      indifferent even with her father, that Albinia trembled lest he might
      withdraw the attention so improperly received. When this dreary state of
      things had lasted more than a week, he did tell her that if she were tired
      of the lessons, it was not worth while to proceed; but that he had hoped
      for more perseverance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fear of losing these, her great pride and pleasure, overcame her. She
      maintained her grim composure till he had left her, but then fell into a
      violent fit of crying, in which Albinia found her, and which dissolved the
      reserve into complaints that every one was very cruel and unkind, and she
      was the most miserable girl in all the world; papa was going to take away
      from her the only one thing that made it tolerable!
    </p>
    <p>
      Reasoning was of no use; to try to show her that it was her own behaviour
      that had annoyed him, only made her mamma appear equally hard-hearted, and
      she continued wretched all the rest of the day, refusing consolation, and
      only so far improved that avowed discontent was better than sullenness.
      The next morning, she found out that it was not the world that was in
      league against her, but that she had fallen into the condition which she
      had thought past for ever. This was worst of all, and her disappointment
      and dejection lasted not only all that long day, but all the next, making
      her receive all kindnesses with a broken-down, woebegone manner, and reply
      to all cheerful encouragements with despair about anything ever making her
      good. Albinia tried to put her in mind of the Source of all goodness; but
      any visible acceptance of personal applications of religious teaching had
      not yet been accomplished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gradually all cleared up again, and things went well till for some fresh
      trivial cause or no cause, the whole process was repeated&mdash;sulking,
      injured innocence, and bitter repentance. This time, Mr. Kendal
      pronounced, &lsquo;This is low spirits, far more than temper,&rsquo; and he
      thenceforth dealt with these moods with a tender consideration that
      Albinia admired, though she thought at times that to treat them more like
      temper than spirits might be better for Sophy; but it was evident that the
      poor child herself had at present little if any power either of averting
      such an access, or of shaking it off. The danger of her father&rsquo;s treatment
      seemed to be, that the humours would be acquiesced in, like changes in the
      weather, and that she might be encouraged neither to repent, nor to
      struggle; while her captivity made her much more liable to the tedium and
      sinking of heart that predisposed her to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      There seemed to be nothing to be done but to bear patiently with them
      while they lasted, to console the victim afterwards, lead her to prayer
      and resolute efforts, and above all to pray for her, as well as to avoid
      occasions of bringing them on; but this was not possible, since no one
      could live without occasional contradiction, and Sophy could sometimes
      bear a strong remonstrance or great disappointment, when at others a hint,
      or an almost imperceptible vexation, destroyed her peace for days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kendal bore patiently with her variations, and did his best to amuse
      away her gloom. It was wonderful how much of his own was gone, and how
      much more alive he was. He had set himself to attack the five
      public-houses and seven beer-shops in Tibbs&rsquo;s Alley, and since his eyes
      had been once opened, it seemed as if the disorders became more flagrant
      every day. At last, he pounced on a misdemeanour which he took care should
      come before the magistrates, and he was much annoyed to find the case
      dismissed for want of evidence. One Sunday he beheld the end of a fray
      begun during service-time; he caused an information to be laid, and went
      himself to the petty sessions to represent the case, but the result was a
      nominal penalty. The Admiral was a seeker of popularity, and though owning
      that the town was in a shocking state, and making great promises when
      talked to on general points, yet he could never make up his mind to punish
      any &lsquo;poor fellow,&rsquo; unless he himself were in a passion, when he would go
      any length. The other magistrates would not interfere; and all the
      satisfaction Mr. Kendal obtained was being told how much he was wanted on
      the bench.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the few respectable Tibbs&rsquo;s Alleyites told him that it was of no
      use to complain, for the publicans boasted of their impunity, snapped
      their fingers at him, and drank Admiral Osborn&rsquo;s health as their friend.
      The consequence was, that Mr. Kendal took a magnanimous resolution,
      ordered a copy of Burn&rsquo;s Justice, and at the September Quarter Sessions
      actually rode over to Hadminster, and took the oaths.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the whole, the expectation was more formidable than the reality.
      However much he disliked applying himself to business, no one understood
      it better. The value of his good sense, judgment, and acuteness was
      speedily felt. Mr. Nugent, the chairman, depended on him as his ally, and
      often as his adviser; and as he was thus made to feel himself of weight
      and importance, his aversion subsided, and he almost learnt to look
      forward to a chat with Mr. Nugent; or whether he looked forward to it or
      not, there could be no doubt that he enjoyed it. Though still shy, grave,
      silent, and inert, there was a great alteration in him since the time when
      he had had no friends, no interests, no pursuits beyond his study; and
      there was every reason to think that, in spite of the many severe shocks
      to his mauvaise honte, he was a much happier man.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife could not regret that his magisterial proceedings led to a
      coolness with the Osborns, augmented by a vestry-meeting, at which Mr.
      Dusautoy had begged him to be present. The Admiral and his party surpassed
      themselves in their virulence against whatever the vicar proposed, until
      they fairly roused Mr. Kendal&rsquo;s ire, and &lsquo;he came out upon them all like a
      lion;&rsquo; and with force appearing the greater from being so seldom exerted,
      he represented Mr. Dusautoy&rsquo;s conduct in appropriate terms, showing full
      appreciation of his merits, and holding up their own course before them in
      its true light, till they had nothing to say for themselves. It was the
      vicar&rsquo;s first visible victory. The increased congregation showed how much
      way he had made with the poor, and Mr. Kendal taking his part openly, drew
      over many of the tradespeople, who had begun to feel the influence of his
      hearty nature and consistent uprightness, and had become used to what had
      at first appeared innovations. Mr. Dusautoy, in thanking Mr. Kendal,
      begged him to allow himself to be nominated his churchwarden next Easter,
      and having consented while his blood was up, there was no danger that,
      however he might dislike the prospect, he would falter when the time
      should come.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was &lsquo;a green Yule,&rsquo; a Christmas like an April day, and even the
      lengthening days and strengthening cold of January attaining to nothing
      more than three slight hoar-frosts, each quickly melting into mud, and the
      last concluding in rain and fog.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What would Willow Lawn have been without the drainage?&rsquo; Albinia often
      thought when she paddled down the wet streets, and saw the fields flooded.
      The damp had such an effect upon Sophy&rsquo;s throat, temper, and whole nervous
      system, that her moods had few intervals, and Albinia wrote to the surgeon
      a detail of her symptoms, asking if she had not better be removed into a
      more favourable air. But he pronounced that the injury of the transport
      would outbalance the casual evils of the bad weather, and as the rain and
      fog mitigated, she improved; but there were others on whom the heavy moist
      air had a more fatal effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning, Mr. Kendal saw his wife descending the picturesque rugged
      stone staircase that led outside the house to the upper stories of the old
      block of buildings under the hill, nearly opposite to Willow Lawn. She
      came towards him with tears still in her eyes as she said, &lsquo;Poor Mrs.
      Simkins has just lost her little girl, and I am afraid the two boys are
      sickening.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you mean? Is the fever there again?&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Kendal in the
      utmost consternation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did you not know it? Lucy has been very anxious about the child, who was
      in her class.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have not taken Lucy to a house with a fever!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I thought it safer not, though she wanted very much to go.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you have been going yourself!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was a low, lingering fever. I had not thought it infectious, and even
      now I believe it is only one of those that run through an over-crowded
      family. The only wonder is, that they are ever well in such a place. Dear
      Edmund, don&rsquo;t be angry; it is what I used to do continually at Fairmead. I
      never caught anything; and there is plenty of chloride of lime, and all
      that. I never imagined you would disapprove.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is the very place where the fever began before!&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal,
      almost under his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of going into the house, he made her turn into the garden, where
      little Maurice was being promenaded in the sun. He stretched out from his
      nurse&rsquo;s arms to go to them, and Albinia was going towards him, but her
      husband held her fast, and said, &lsquo;I beg you will not take the child till
      you have changed your dress.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia was quite subdued, alarmed at the effect on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You must go away at once,&rsquo; he said presently. &lsquo;How soon can you be ready?
      You had better take Lucy and Maurice at once to your brother&rsquo;s. They will
      excuse the liberty when they know the cause.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And pray what is to become of poor Sophy?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never going out, there may be the less risk for her. I will take care of
      her myself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As if I was going to endure that!&rsquo; cried Albinia. &lsquo;No, no, Edmund, I am
      not likely to run away from you and Sophy! You may send Lucy off, if you
      like, but certainly not me, or if you do I shall come back the same
      evening.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should be much happier if you were gone.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you, but what should I be? No, if it were to be caught here, which
      I don&rsquo;t believe, now the pond is gone, it would be of no use to send me
      away, after I have been into the house with it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her resolution and Sophy&rsquo;s need prevailed, and most unwillingly Mr. Kendal
      gave up the point. She was persuaded that he was acting on a panic, the
      less to be wondered at after all he had suffered. She thought the chief
      danger was from the effect of his fears, and would fain have persuaded him
      to remain at Fairmead with Lucy, but she was not prepared to hear him
      insist on likewise removing Maurice. She had promised not to enter the
      sick room again, and pleaded that the little boy need never be taken into
      the street&mdash;that the fever was not likely to come across the running
      stream&mdash;that the Fairmead nursery was full enough already.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kendal was inexorable. &lsquo;I hope you may never see what I have seen,&rsquo; he
      said gravely, and Albinia was silenced.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man who had lost so many children might be allowed to be morbidly
      jealous of the health of the rest. But it was a cruel stroke to her to be
      obliged to part with her noble little boy, just when his daily advances in
      walking and talking made him more charming than ever. Her eyes were full
      of tears, and she struggled to choke back some pettish rebellious words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You do not like to trust him with Susan,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal; &lsquo;you had
      better come with him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Albinia, &lsquo;I ought to stay here, and if you judge it right,
      Maurice must go. I&rsquo;ll go and speak to Susan.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And away she ran, for she had no power just then to speak in a wifely
      manner. It was not easy to respect a man in a panic so extremely
      inconvenient.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was resolved on an immediate start, and the next few hours were spent
      in busy preparation, and in watching lest the excited Lucy should frighten
      her sister. Albinia tried to persuade Mr. Kendal at least to sleep at
      Fairmead that night, and after watching him drive off, she hurried,
      dashing away the tears that would gather again and again in her eyes, to
      hold council with the Dusautoys on the best means of stopping the course
      of the malady, by depriving it of its victims.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had a quiet snug evening with Sophy, whom she had so much interested
      in the destitution of the sick children as to set her to work at some
      night-gear for them, and she afterwards sat long over the fire trying to
      read to silence the longing after the little soft cheek that had never yet
      been laid to rest without her caress, and foreboding that Mr. Kendal would
      return from his dark solitary drive with his spirits at the lowest ebb.
    </p>
    <p>
      So late that she had begun to hope that Winifred had obeyed her behest and
      detained him, she heard his step, and before she could run to meet him, he
      had already shut himself into the study.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was at the door in a moment; she feared he had thought her self-willed
      in the morning, and she was the more bent on rousing him. She knocked&mdash;she
      opened the door. He had thrown himself into his arm-chair, and was bending
      over the dreary, smouldering, sulky log and white ashes, and his face, as
      he raised his head, was as if the whole load of care and sorrow had
      suddenly descended again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am sorry you sat up,&rsquo; was of course his beginning, conveying anything
      but welcome; but she knew that this only meant that he was in a state of
      depression. She took hold of his hand, chilled with holding the reins,
      told him of the good fire in the morning-room, and fairly drew him
      up-stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      There the lamp burnt brightly, and the red fire cast a merry glow over the
      shining chintz curtains, and the two chairs drawn so cosily towards the
      fire, the kettle puffing on the hearth, and Albinia&rsquo;s choice little
      bed-room set of tea-china ready on the small table. The cheerfulness
      seemed visibly to diffuse itself over his face, but he still struggled to
      cherish his gloom, &lsquo;Thank you, but I would not have had you take all this
      trouble, my dear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It would be a great deal more trouble if you caught a bad cold. I meant
      you to sleep at Fairmead.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, they pressed me very kindly, but I could not bear not to come home.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And how did Maurice comport himself?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He talked to the horse and then went to sleep, and he was not at all shy
      with his aunt after the first. He watched the children, but had not begun
      to play with them. Still I think he will be quite happy with Lucy there,
      and I hope it will not be for long.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a favourable sign that Mr. Kendal communicated all these
      particulars without being plied with questions, and Albinia went on with
      the more spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I hope it may not be for long. We have been holding a great council
      against the enemy, and I do hope that we have really done something. No,
      you need not be afraid, I have not been there again, but we have been
      routing out the nucleus, and hope we may starve out the fever for want of
      victims. You never saw such a swarm as we had to turn out. There were
      twenty-three people to be considered for.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Twenty-three! Have you turned out the whole block?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I wish we had; but that would have been seventy-five. This is only
      from those two tenements with one door!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Impossible!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should have thought so; but the lawful inhabitants make up sixteen, and
      there were seven lodgers.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kendal gave a kind of groan, and asked what she had done; she detailed
      the measures.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Twenty-three people in those two houses, and seventy-five in the whole
      block of building?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Too true. And if you could only see the rooms! The windows that wont
      open; the roofs that open too much; the dirt on the staircases, and, oh!
      the horrible smells!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It shall not go on,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal. &lsquo;I will look over the place.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not till the fever is out of it,&rsquo; hastily interposed Albinia.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made a sign of assent, and went on: &lsquo;I will certainly talk to
      Pettilove, and have the place repaired, if it be at my own expense.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia lifted up her eyes, not understanding at whose expense it should
      be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The fact is,&rsquo; continued Mr. Kendal, &lsquo;that there has been little to induce
      me to take interest in the property. Old Mr. Meadows was, as you know, a
      successful solicitor, and purchased these various town tenements bit by
      bit, and then settled them very strictly on his grandson. He charged the
      property with life incomes to his widow and daughters, and to me; but the
      land is in the hands of trustees until my son&rsquo;s majority, and Pettilove is
      the only surviving trustee.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The burning colour mantled in Albinia&rsquo;s face, and almost inaudibly she
      said, &lsquo;I beg your pardon, Edmund; I have done you moat grievous injustice.
      I thought you <i>would</i> not see&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You did not think unjustly, my dear. I ought to have paid more attention
      to the state of affairs, and have kept Pettilove in order. But I knew
      nothing of English affairs, and was glad to be spared the unpleasant
      charge. The consequence of leaving a man like that irresponsible never
      occurred to me. His whole conscience in the matter is to have a large sum
      to put into Gilbert&rsquo;s hands when he comes of age. Why, he upholds those
      dens of iniquity in Tibbs&rsquo;s Alley on that very ground!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor Gilbert! I am afraid a large sum so collected is not likely to do
      him much good! and at one-and-twenty&mdash;! But that is one notion of
      faithfulness!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia was much happier after that conversation. She could better endure
      to regret her own injustice than to believe her husband the cruel
      landlord; and it was no small advance that he had afforded her an
      explanation which once he would have deemed beyond the reach of female
      capacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of the lack of little Maurice&rsquo;s bright presence, which, to
      Albinia&rsquo;s great delight, his father missed as much as she did, the period
      of quarantine sped by cheerfully. Sophy had not a single sullen fit the
      whole time, and Albinia having persuaded Mr. Kendal that it would be a
      sanatory measure to whitewash the study ceiling, he was absolutely forced
      to turn out of it and live in the morning-room, with all his books piled
      up in the dining-room. And on that great occasion Albinia abstracted two
      fusty, faded, green canvas blinds from the windows, carried them off with
      a pair of tongs, and pushed them into a bonfire in the garden, persuaded
      they were the last relics of the old fever. She had the laurels cut, the
      curtains changed, the windows cleaned, and altogether made the room so
      much lighter, that when Mr. Kendal again took possession, he did not look
      at all sure whether he liked it; and though he was courteously grateful,
      he did not avail himself of the den half so much as when it had more
      congenial gloom. But then he had the morning-room as a resort, and it was
      one of Albinia&rsquo;s bargains with herself, that as far as her own influence
      could prevent it, neither he nor Sophy should ever render it a literal
      boudoir.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sense of snugness that the small numbers produced was one great charm,
      and made Mr. Kendal come unusually far out of his shell. His chief
      sanatory precaution was to take Albinia out for a drive or walk every day,
      and these expeditions were greatly enjoyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, after a visit from her old nurse, Sophy received Albinia with the
      words,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, mamma,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;old nurse has been telling me such things. I shall
      never be cross with Aunt Maria again. It is such a sad story, just like
      one in a book, if she was but that kind of person.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aunt Maria! I remember Mrs. Dusautoy once saying she gave her the idea of
      happiness shattered, but&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did she?&rsquo; exclaimed Sophy. &lsquo;I never thought Aunt Maria could have done
      anything but fidget everybody that came near her; but old nurse says a
      gentleman was once in love with her, and a very handsome young gentleman
      too. Old Mr. Pringle&rsquo;s nephew it was, a very fine young officer in the
      army. I want you to ask papa if it is true. Nurse says that he wrote to
      make an offer for her, very handsomely, but grandpapa did not choose that
      both his daughters should go quite away; so he locked the letter up, and
      said no, and never told her, and she thought the captain had been trifling
      and playing her false, and pined and fretted, till she got into this
      nervous way, and fairly wore herself out, nurse says, and came to be what
      she is now, instead of the prettiest young lady in the town! And then,
      mamma, when grandpapa died, she found the letter in his papers, and one
      inside for her, that had never been given to her; and by that time there
      was no hope, for Captain Pringle had gone out with his regiment, and
      married a rich young lady in the Indies! Oh, mamma! you see she really is
      deserted, and it is all man&rsquo;s treachery that has broken her heart. I
      thought people always died or went into convents&mdash;I don&rsquo;t mean that
      Aunt Maria could have done that, but I did not think that way of hers was
      a broken heart!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If she has had such troubles, it should indeed make us try to be very
      forbearing with her,&rsquo; said Albinia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you ask papa about it?&rsquo; entreated Sophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, certainly; but you must not make sure whether he will think it right
      to tell us. Poor Aunt Maria; I do think some part of it must be true!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But, mamma, is that really like deserted love?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear, I don&rsquo;t think I ever saw deserted love,&rsquo; said Albinia, rather
      amused. &lsquo;I suppose troubles of any kind, if not&mdash;I mean, I suppose,
      vexations&mdash;make people show their want of spirits in the way most
      accordant with their natural dispositions, and so your poor aunt has grown
      querulous and anxious.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If she has such a real grand reason for being unhappy, I shall not be
      cross about it now, except&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy gave a sigh, and Albinia bade her good night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kendal had never heard the story before, but he remembered many
      circumstances in corroboration. He knew that Mr. Pringle had a nephew in
      the army, he recollected that he had made a figure in Maria&rsquo;s letters to
      India; and that he had subsequently married a lady in the Mauritius, and
      settled down on her father&rsquo;s estate. He testified also to the bright gay
      youth of poor Maria, and his surprise at the premature loss of beauty and
      spirits; and from his knowledge of old Mr. Meadows, he believed him
      capable of such an act of domestic tyranny. Maria had always been looked
      upon as a mere child, and if her father did not choose to part with her,
      he would think it for her good, and his own peace, for her not to be aware
      of the proposal. He was much struck, for he had not suspected his
      sister-in-law to be capable of such permanent feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There was little to help her in driving it away,&rsquo; said Albinia. &lsquo;Few
      occupations or interests, and very little change, to prevent it from
      preying on her spirits.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;True,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal; &lsquo;a narrow education and limited sphere are sad
      evils in such cases.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you think anything can be a cure for disappointment?&rsquo; asked Sophy, in
      such a solemn, earnest tone, that Albinia was disposed to laugh; but she
      knew that this would be a dire offence, and was much surprised that Sophy
      had so far broken through her reserve, as to mingle in their conversation
      on such a subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Occupation,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal, but speaking rather as if from duty than
      from conviction. &lsquo;There are many sources of happiness, even if shipwreck
      have been made on one venture. Your aunt had few resources to which to
      turn her mind. Every pursuit or study is a help stored up against the
      vacuity which renders every care more corroding.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well!&rsquo; said Sophy, in her blunt, downright way, &lsquo;I think it would take
      all the spirit out of everything.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope you will never be tried,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal, with a mournful smile,
      as if he did not choose to confess that she had divined too rightly the
      probable effect of trouble upon her own temperament.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose,&rsquo; said Albinia, &lsquo;that the real cure can be but one thing for
      that, as for any other trouble. I mean, &ldquo;Thy will be done.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t
      suppose anything else would give energy to turn to other duties. But it
      would be more to the purpose to resolve to be more considerate to poor
      Maria.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall never be impatient with her again,&rsquo; said Sophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      And though at first the discovery of so romantic a cause for poor Miss
      Meadows&rsquo;s fretfulness dignified it in Sophy&rsquo;s eyes, yet it did not prove
      sufficient to make it tolerable when she tormented the window-blinds,
      teased the fire, was shocked at Sophy&rsquo;s favourite studies, or insisting on
      her wishing to see Maria Drury. Nay, the bathos often rendered her petty
      unconscious provocations the more harassing, and Sophy often felt, in an
      agony of self-reproach, that she ought to have known herself too well to
      expect to show forbearance with any one when she was under the influence
      of ill-temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Easter week Mr. Ferrars brought Lucy and Maurice home, and Gilbert came
      for a short holiday.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert was pleased when he was called to go over the empty houses with
      his father, Mr. Ferrars, and a mason.
    </p>
    <p>
      Back they came, horrified at the dreadful disrepair, at the narrow area
      into which such numbers were crowded, and still more at the ill odours
      which Mr. Ferrars and the mason had gallantly investigated, till they
      detected the absence of drains, as well as convinced themselves that
      mending roofs, floors, or windows, would be a mere mockery unless the
      whole were pulled down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ferrars was more than ever thankful to be a country parson, and mused
      on the retribution that the miasma, fostered by the avarice of the
      grandfather and the neglect of the father, had brought on the family.
      Dives cannot always scorn Lazarus without suffering even in this life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert, in the glory of castle-building, was talking eagerly of the
      thorough renovation that should take place, the sweep that should be made
      of all the old tenements, and the wide healthy streets and model cottages
      that should give a new aspect to the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kendal prepared for the encounter with Pettilove, and his son begged
      to go with him, to which he consented, saying that it was time Gilbert
      should have an opinion in a matter that affected him so nearly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert&rsquo;s opinion of the interview was thus announced on his return: &lsquo;If
      there ever was a brute in the world, it is that Pettilove!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then he wont consent to do anything?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, indeed! Say what my father or I would to him, it was all of not the
      slightest use. He smiled, and made little intolerable nods, and regretted&mdash;but
      there were the settlements, and his late lamented partner! A parcel of
      stuff. Not so much as a broken window will he mend! He says he is not
      authorized!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quite true,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal. &lsquo;The man is warranted in his proceedings,
      and thinks them his duty, though I believe he has a satisfaction in the
      power of thwarting me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure he has!&rsquo; cried Gilbert. &lsquo;I am sure there was spite in his grin
      when he pulled out that horrid old parchment, with the lines a yard long,
      and read us out the abominable old crabbed writing, all about the houses,
      messuages, and tenements thereupon, and a lot of lawyer&rsquo;s jargon. I&rsquo;m sure
      I thought it was left to Peter Pettilove himself. And when I came to
      understand it, one would have thought it took my father to be the worst
      enemy we had in the world, bent on cheating us!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is the assumption on which settlements are drawn up, Gilbert,&rsquo; said
      his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can nothing be done, then?&rsquo; said Albinia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thus much,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal. &lsquo;Pettilove will not object to our putting
      the houses somewhat in repair, as, in fact, that will be making a present
      to Gilbert; but he will not spend a farthing on them of the trust, except
      to hinder their absolute falling, nor will he make any regulation on the
      number of lodgers. As to taking them down, that is, as I always supposed,
      out of the question, though I think the trustees might have stretched a
      point, being certain of both my wishes and Gilbert&rsquo;s.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you think,&rsquo; said Mr. Ferrars, looking up from his book, &lsquo;that a
      sanatory commission might be got to over-ride Gilbert&rsquo;s guardian?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My guardian! do not call him so!&rsquo; muttered Gilbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am afraid,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal, &lsquo;that unless your commission emulated of
      Albinia and Dusautoy they would have little perception of the evils. Our
      local authorities are obtuse in such matters.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Agitate! agitate!&rsquo; murmured Mr. Ferrars, going on with his book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Albinia, &lsquo;at least there is one beer-shop less in Tibbs&rsquo;s
      Alley. And if there are tolerable seasons, I daresay paint, whitewash, and
      windows to open, may keep the place moderately wholesome till&mdash;Are
      you sixteen yet, Gilbert? Five years.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, and then&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert came and sat down beside her, and they built a scheme for the
      almshouses so much wanted. Gilbert was sure the accumulation would easily
      cover the expense, and Albinia had many an old woman, who it was hoped
      might live to enjoy the intended paradise there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, yes, I promise,&rsquo; cried Gilbert, warming with the subject, &lsquo;the first
      thing I shall do&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, don&rsquo;t promise,&rsquo; said Albinia. &lsquo;Do it from your heart, or not at all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, don&rsquo;t promise, Gilbert,&rsquo; said Sophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why not, Sophy?&rsquo; he said good-humouredly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because you are just what you feel at the moment,&rsquo; said Sophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t think I should keep it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The grave answer fell like lead, and Albinia told her she was not kind or
      just to her brother. But she still looked steadily at him, and answered,
      &lsquo;I cannot help it. What is truth, is truth, and Gilbert cares only for
      what he sees at the moment.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is truth need not always be fully uttered,&rsquo; said Albinia. &lsquo;I hope
      you may find it untrue.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But Sophy&rsquo;s words would recur, and weigh on her painfully.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The summer had just begun, when notice was given that a Confirmation would
      take place in the autumn; and Lucy&rsquo;s name was one of the first sent in to
      Mr. Dusautoy. His plan was to collect his candidates in weekly classes of
      a few at a time, and likewise to see as much as he could of them in
      private.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! mamma!&rsquo; exclaimed Lucy, returning from her first class, &lsquo;Mr. Dusautoy
      has given us each a paper, where we are to set down our christening days,
      and our godfathers and godmothers. And only think, I had not the least
      notion when I was christened. I could tell nothing but that Mr. Wenlock
      was my godfather! It made me feel quite foolish not to know my
      godmothers.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We were in no situation to have things done in order,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal,
      gravely. &lsquo;If I recollect rightly, one of your godmothers was Captain Lee&rsquo;s
      pretty young wife, who died a few weeks after.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And the other?&rsquo; said Lucy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your mother, I believe,&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy employed herself in filling up her paper, and exclaimed, &lsquo;Now I do
      not know the date! Can you tell me that, papa?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was the Christmas-day next after your birth,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;I remember
      that, for we took you to spend Christmas at the nearest station of troops,
      and the chaplain christened you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy wrote down the particulars, and exclaimed, &lsquo;What an old baby I must
      have been! Six months old! And I wonder when Sophy was christened. I never
      knew who any of her godfathers and godmothers were. Did you, Sophy?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No&mdash;&rsquo; she was looking up at her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sudden flush of colour came over his face, and he left the room in
      haste.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, Sophy!&rsquo; exclaimed Lucy, &lsquo;one would think you had not been christened
      at all!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Even the light Lucy was alarmed at the sound of her own words. The same
      idea had thrilled across Albinia; but on turning her eyes on Sophy, she
      saw a countenance flushed, anxious, but full rather of trembling hope than
      of dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few seconds Mr. Kendal came back with a thick red pocket-book in his
      hand, and produced the certificate of the private baptism of Sophia,
      daughter of Edmund and Lucy Kendal, at Talloon, March 17th, 1838.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy&rsquo;s face had more disappointment in it than satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can explain the circumstances to you now,&rsquo; said her father. &lsquo;At Talloon
      we were almost out of reach of any chaplains, and, as you know, were
      almost the only English. We always intended to take you to the nearest
      station, as had been done with Lucy, but your dear mother was never well
      enough to bear the journey; and when our next little one was born, it was
      so plain that he could not live, that I sent in haste to beg that the
      chaplain would come to us. It was then that you were both baptized, and
      before the week was over, he buried little Henry. It was the first of our
      troubles. We never again had health or spirits for any festive occasion
      while we continued in India, and thus the ceremony was never completed. In
      fact, I take shame to myself for having entirely forgotten that you had
      never been received into the congregation.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then I have told a falsehood whenever I said the Catechism!&rsquo; burst out
      Sophy. Lucy would have laughed, and Albinia could almost have been amused
      at the turn her displeasure had taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was not your fault,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He evidently wished the subject to be at an end, excepting that in silence
      he laid before Albinia&rsquo;s eyes the certificate of the baptism of the
      twin-brothers, not long after the first arrival in India. He then put the
      book in his pocket, and began, as usual, to read aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t go, mamma,&rsquo; said Sophy, when she had been carried to her own
      room at bed-time, and made ready for the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia was only too glad to linger, in the hope to be admitted into some
      of the recesses of that untransparent nature, and by way of assistance,
      said, &lsquo;I was not at all prepared for this discovery.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy drew a long sigh, and said, &lsquo;If I had never been christened, I
      should have thought there was some hope for me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That would have been too dreadful. How could you imagine your papa
      capable&mdash;?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thought I had found out why I am so horrid! exclaimed Sophy. &lsquo;Oh, if I
      could only make a fresh beginning! Mamma, do pray give me a Prayer Book.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia gave it to her, and she hastily turned the pages to the Order for
      Private Baptism.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At least I have not made the promises and vows!&rsquo; she said, as if her
      stern conscientiousness obtained some relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not formally made them,&rsquo; said Albinia; &lsquo;but you cannot have a right to
      the baptismal blessings, except on those conditions.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mamma, then I never had the sign of the cross on my forehead! It does not
      feel blest!&rsquo; And then, hastily and low, she muttered,&rsquo; Oh! is that why I
      never could bear the cross in all my life!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nay, my poor Sophy, you must not think of it like a spell. Many bear the
      cross no better, who have had it marked on their brows.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can it be done now?&rsquo; cried Sophy, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly; I think it ought to be done. We will see what your father
      says.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, mamma, beg him, pray him!&rsquo; exclaimed Sophy. &lsquo;I know it will make me
      begin to be good! I can&rsquo;t bear not to be one of those marked and sealed.
      Oh! and, mamma, you will be my godmother? Can&rsquo;t you? If the gleams of
      goodness and brightness do find me out, they are always from you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think I might be, dear child,&rsquo; said Albinia, &lsquo;but Mr. Dusautoy must
      tell us whether I may. But, indeed, I am afraid to see you reckon too much
      on this. The essential, the regenerating grace, is yours already, and can
      save you from yourself, and Confirmation adds the rest&mdash;but you must
      not think of any of these like a charm, which will save you all further
      trouble with yourself. They do not kill the faults, but they enable you to
      deal with them. Even baptism itself, you know, has destroyed the guilt of
      past sin, but does not hinder subsequent temptation.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia hardly knew how far Sophy attended to this caution, for all she
      said was to reiterate the entreaty that the omitted ceremony might be
      supplied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kendal gave a ready consent, as soon as he was told that Sophy so
      ardently wished for it&mdash;so willing, indeed, that Albinia was
      surprised, until he went on to say, &lsquo;No one need be aware of the matter
      beyond ourselves. Your brother and sister would, I have no doubt, act as
      sponsors. Nay, if Ferrars would officiate, we need hardly mention it even
      to Dusautoy. It could take place in your sitting-room.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But, Edmund!&rsquo; began Albinia, aghast, &lsquo;would that be the right thing? I
      hardly think Maurice would consent.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are not imagining anything so preposterous or inexpedient as to wish
      to bring Sophia forward in church,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal; &lsquo;even if she were
      physically capable of it, I should not choose to expose her to anything so
      painful or undesirable.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am afraid, then,&rsquo; said Albinia, &lsquo;that it will not be done at all. It is
      not receiving her into the congregation to have this service read before
      half-a-dozen people in my sitting-room.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Better not have it done at all, then,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal. &lsquo;It is not
      essential. I will not have her made a spectacle.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you only consult Mr. Dusautoy?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do not wish Mr. Dusautoy to interfere in my family regulations. I mean,
      that I have a great respect for him, but as a clergyman, and one wedded to
      form, he would not take into account the great evil of making a public
      display, and attracting attention to a girl of her age, station, and
      disposition. And, in fact,&rsquo; added Mr. Kendal, with the same scrupulous
      candour as his daughter always showed, &lsquo;for the sake of my own position,
      and the effect of example, I should not wish this unfortunate omission to
      be known.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suspect,&rsquo; said Albinia, &lsquo;that the example of repairing it would speak
      volumes of good.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is mere absurdity to speak of it!&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal. &lsquo;The poor child is
      not to leave her couch yet for weeks.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy was told in the morning that the question was under consideration,
      and Lucy was strictly forbidden to mention the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      When next Mr. Kendal came to read with Sophy, she said imploringly, &lsquo;Papa,
      have you thought?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I have done so; but your mamma thinks, and, on
      examination of the subject, I perceive she is right, that the service has
      no meaning unless it take place in the church.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Sophy; &lsquo;but you know I am to be allowed to go about in July.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will hardly be equal to any fatigue even then, I fear, my dear; and
      you would find this publicity extremely trying and unpleasant.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It would not last ten minutes,&rsquo; said Sophy, &lsquo;and I am sure I should not
      care! I should have something else to think about. Oh! papa, when my
      forehead aches with surliness, it does feel so unblest, so uncrossed!&rsquo; and
      she put her hand over it, &lsquo;and all the books and hymns seem not to belong
      to me. I think I shall be able to keep off the tempers when I have a right
      in the cross.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! my child, I am afraid the tempers are a part of your physical
      constitution,&rsquo; he returned, mournfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You mean that I am like you, papa,&rsquo; said Sophy. &lsquo;I think I might at least
      learn to be really like you, and if I must feel miserable, not to be
      unkind and sulky! And then I should leave off even the being unhappy about
      nothing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes brightened, but her father shook his head sadly, and said, &lsquo;You
      would not be like me, my dear, if depression never made you selfish. But,&rsquo; 
      he added, with an effort, &lsquo;you will not suffer so much from low spirits
      when you are in better health, and able to move about.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, no!&rsquo; exclaimed Sophy; &lsquo;I often feel so sick of lying here, that I
      feel as if I never could be sulky if only I might walk about, and go from
      one room to another when I please! But papa, you will let me be admitted
      into the Church when I am able, will you not?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It shall be well weighed, Sophy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy knew her father too well, and had too much reticence to say any
      more. He was certainly meditating deeply, and reading too, indeed he would
      almost have appeared to have a fit of the study, but for little Maurice, a
      tyrannical little gentleman, who domineered over the entire household, and
      would have been grievously spoilt, if his mother had not taken all the
      crossing the stout little will upon herself. He had a gallant pair of
      legs, and the disposition of a young Centaur, he seemed to divide the
      world into things that could be ridden on, and that could not; and when he
      bounced at the study door, with &lsquo;Papa! gee! gee!&rsquo; and lifted up his round,
      rosy face, and despotic blue eyes, Mr. Kendal&rsquo;s foot was at his service,
      and the study was brown no longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result of Mr. Kendal&rsquo;s meditations was an invitation to his wife to
      drive with him to Fairmead.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was a most enjoyable drive, the weather too hot and sunny, perhaps,
      for Albinia&rsquo;s preferences, but thoroughly penetrating, and giving energy
      to, her East-Indian husband, and making the whole country radiant with
      sunny beauty&mdash;the waving hay-fields falling before the mower&rsquo;s
      scythe, the ranks of hay-makers tossing the fragrant grass, the growing
      corn softly waving in the summer breeze, the river blue with reflected
      sky, the hedges glowing with stately fox-gloves, or with blushing wreaths
      of eglantine. And how cool, fresh, and fair was the beech-avenue at
      Fairmead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet though Albinia came to it with the fond tenderness of old association,
      it was not with the regretful clinging of the first visit, when it seemed
      to her the natural home to which she still really belonged. Nor had she
      the least thought about producing an impression of her own happiness, and
      scarcely any whether &lsquo;Edmund&rsquo; would be amused and at ease, though knowing
      he had a stranger to encounter in the person of Winifred&rsquo;s sister, Mary
      Reid.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was not a long day. It was only too short, though Mr. and Mrs. Kendal
      stayed three hours longer than on the last occasion. Mr. Kendal faced Mary
      Reid without flinching, and she, having been previously informed that
      Albinia&rsquo;s husband was the most silent and shy man in existence, began to
      doubt her sister&rsquo;s veracity. And Albinia, instead of dealing out a shower
      of fireworks, to hide what, if not gloom, was at least twilight, was now
      &lsquo;temperately bright,&rsquo; talking naturally of what most concerned her with
      the sprightliness of her happy temper, but without effort; and gratifying
      Winifred by a great deal more notice of the new niece and namesake than
      she had ever bestowed on either of her predecessors in their infant days.
      Moreover, Lucy&rsquo;s two long visits had made Mrs. Ferrars feel a strong
      interest in her, and, with a sort of maternal affection, she inquired
      after the cuttings of the myrtle which she had given her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said Albinia, &lsquo;I never honoured gardening so much.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know you would never respect it in me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As you know, I love a walk with an object, and never could abide breaking
      my back, pottering over a pink with a stem that wont support it, and a
      calyx that wont hold it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And Lucy converted you when I could not!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you had known my longing for some wholesome occupation for her, such
      as could hurt neither herself nor any one else, and the pleasure of seeing
      her engrossed by anything innocent, making it so easy to gratify her. Why,
      a new geranium is a constant fund of ecstasy, and I do not believe she was
      ever so grateful to her father in her life as when he gave her a
      forcing-frame. Anything is a blessing that makes people contented at home,
      and takes them out of themselves.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lucy is a very nice, pleasant inmate; her ready obligingness and facility
      of adapting herself make her very agreeable.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Albinia, &lsquo;she is the &ldquo;very woman,&rdquo; taking her complexion from
      things around, and so she will go smoothly through the world, and be
      always preferred to my poor turbid, deep-souled Sophy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you going to be very angry with me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! you do not know Sophy! Poor, dear child! I do so long that she could
      have&mdash;if it were but one day, one hour, of real, free, glowing
      happiness! I think it would sweeten and open her heart wonderfully just to
      have known it! If I could but see any chance of it, but I am afraid her
      health will always be against her, and oh! that dreadful sense of
      depression! Do you know, Winifred, I do think love would be the best
      chance. Now, don&rsquo;t laugh; I do assure you there is no reason Sophy should
      not be very handsome.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quite as handsome as the owl&rsquo;s children, my dear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, the owls are the only young birds fit to be seen. But I tell you,
      Sophy&rsquo;s profile is as regular as her father&rsquo;s, and animation makes her
      eyes beautiful, and she has grown immensely since she has been lying down,
      so that she will come out without that disproportioned look. If her
      eyebrows were rather less marked, and her complexion&mdash;but that will
      clear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, we will make her a beauty when we are about it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And, after all, affection is the great charm, and if she were attached,
      it would, be so intensely&mdash;and happiness would develop so much that
      is glorious, only hidden down so deep.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope you may find her a male Albinia,&rsquo; said Winifred, a little
      wickedly, &lsquo;but take care. It might be kill or cure, and I fancy when
      sunshine is attracted by shadow, it is more often as it was in your case
      than vice versa.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take care!&rsquo; repeated Albinia, affronted. &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t fancy I am going
      beyond a vague wish, do you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And rather a premature one. How old is Sophy?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Towards fourteen, but years older in thought and in suffering.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia did not hear the result of the conference with her brother till
      she had resumed her seat in the carriage, after having been surprised by
      Mr. Kendal handing in three tall theological tomes. They both had much to
      think over as they drove home in the lengthening shadows. Albinia was
      greatly concerned that Winifred&rsquo;s health had become affected, and that her
      ordinary home duties were beyond her strength. Albinia had formerly
      thought Fairmead parsonage did not give her enough to do, but now she saw
      the gap that she had left; and she had fallen into a maze of musings over
      schemes for helping Winifred, before Mr. Kendal spoke, telling her that he
      had resolved that Sophia&rsquo;s admission into the Church should take place as
      soon as she was equal to the exertion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia asked if she should speak to Mr. Dusautoy, but the manliness of
      Mr. Kendal&rsquo;s character revolted from putting off a confession upon his
      wife; so he went to church the next morning, and saw the vicar afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dusautoy&rsquo;s first thought was gratitude for the effort that the
      resolution must have cost both Mr. Kendal and his daughter; his next, how
      to make the occasion as little trying to their feelings as was consistent
      with his duty and theirs. He saw Sophy, and tried to draw her out, but,
      though far from sullen, she did not reply freely. However, he was
      satisfied, and he wished her, likewise, to consider herself under
      preparation for Confirmation in the autumn. She did all that he wished
      quietly and earnestly, but without much remark, her confidence only came
      forth when her feelings were strongly stirred, and it was remarkable that
      throughout this time of preparation there was not the remotest shadow of
      ill-temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kendal insisted that her London doctor should come to see her at the
      year&rsquo;s end. The improvement had not been all that had been hoped, but it
      was decided that though several hours of each day must still be spent on
      her back, she might move about, join the meals, and do whatever she could
      without over-fatigue. It seemed a great release, but it was a shock to
      find how very little she could do at first, now that she had lost the
      habit of exertion, and of disregard of her discomforts. She had quite shot
      up to more than the ordinary woman&rsquo;s height, and was much taller than her
      sister&mdash;but this hardly gave the advantage Albinia had hoped, for she
      had a weak, overgrown look, and could not help stooping. A number of
      people in a room, or even the sitting upright during a morning call,
      seemed quite to overcome and exhaust her: but still the return to ordinary
      life was such great enjoyment, that she endured all with good temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now the church-going was possible, a fit of exceeding dread came upon
      her. Albinia found her with the tears silently rolling down her cheeks,
      almost as if she were unconscious of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, mamma, I can never do it! I know what I am. I can&rsquo;t let them say I
      will keep all the commandments always! It will not be true!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It will be true that you have the steadfast purpose, my dear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How can it be steadfast when I know I can&rsquo;t?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the old story, and all had to be argued through again how the
      obligation was already incurred at her baptism, and how it was needful
      that she should be sworn to her own side of the great covenant&mdash;how
      the power would be given, and the grace supplied, but that the will and
      purpose to obey was required&mdash;and then Sophy recurred to that
      blessing of the cross for which she longed so earnestly, and which again
      Albinia feared she was regarding in the light of a talisman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ferrars was to be her godfather. Mr. Kendal had wished Aunt Winifred,
      as Lucy called her, to be the godmother, but Sophy had begged earnestly
      for Mrs. Dusautoy, whose kindness had made a great impression.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was not much liking between Mrs. Ferrars and Sophy. Perhaps Sophy
      had been fretted and angered by her quick, decided ways, and rather
      disgusted by the enthusiasm of her brother and sister about Fairmead; and
      she was not gratified by hearing that Winifred was to accompany her
      husband in order to try the experiment of a short absence from cares and
      children.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia, on the contrary, was highly pleased to have Winifred to nurse,
      and desirous of showing off Sophy&rsquo;s reformation. Winifred arrived late in
      the day, with an invalid look, and a great inclination to pine for her
      baby. She was so much tired, that Albinia took her upstairs very soon, and
      put her to bed, sitting with her almost all the evening, hoping that
      downstairs all was going on well.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning, too, went off very well. Mr. Ferrars sought a private
      talk with his old godchild, and though Sophy scarcely answered, she liked
      his kind, frank, affectionate manner, and showed such feeling as he
      wished, so that he fully credited all that his sister thought of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Otherwise, Sophy was kept quiet, to gave her strength and collect her
      thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      At seven o&rsquo;clock in the evening, there was not a formidable congregation.
      Miss Meadows, who had been informed as late as could save offence, had
      treated it as a freak of Mrs. Kendal, resented the injunction of secrecy,
      and would neither be present herself, nor let her mother come out.
      Genevieve, three old men, and a child or two, were the whole number
      present. The daily service at Bayford was an offering made in faith by the
      vicar, for as yet there was very little attendance. &lsquo;But,&rsquo; said Mr.
      Dusautoy, &lsquo;it is the worship of God, not an entertainment to please man&mdash;it
      is all nonsense to talk of its answering or not answering.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kendal was in a state of far greater suffering from shame than his
      daughter, as indeed he deserved, but he endured it with a gallant, almost
      touching resignation. He was the only witness of her baptism, and it
      seemed like a confession, when he had to reply to the questions, by whom,
      and with what words this child had been baptized, when she stood beside
      him overtopping her little godmother. She stood with tightly-locked hands,
      and ebbing colour, which came back in a flood when Mr. Dusautoy took her
      by the hand, and said, &lsquo;We receive this child into the congregation,&rsquo; and
      when he traced the cross on her brow, she stood tremblingly, her lips
      squeezed close together, and after she returned to her place no one saw
      her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia, with her brother and Lucy, were at home by the short cut before
      the carriage could return. She met Sophy at the hall-door, kissed her, and
      said, &lsquo;Now, my dear, you had better lie down, and be quite quiet;&rsquo; then
      followed Winifred into the drawing-room, and took her shawl and bonnet
      from her, lingering for a happy twilight conversation. Lucy came down, and
      went to water her flowers, and by-and-by tea was brought, the gentlemen
      came in from their walk, and Mr. Kendal asked whether Sophy was tired.
      Albinia went up to see. She found her on her couch in the morning room,
      and told her that tea was ready. There was something not promising in the
      voice that replied; and she said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, don&rsquo;t move, my dear, I will bring it to you; you are tired.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No&mdash;I&rsquo;ll go down, thank you.&rsquo; It was the gruff voice!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed you had much better not, my dear. It is only an hour to bed-time,
      and you would only tire yourself for nothing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are tired, Sophy,&rsquo; said her father. &lsquo;You had better lie down while
      you have your tea.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, thank you,&rsquo; growled Sophy, as though hurt by being told to lie down
      before company.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her father put a sofa-cushion behind her, but though she mumbled some
      acknowledgment, it was so surly, that Mrs. Ferrars looked up in surprise,
      and she would not lean back till fatigue gained the ascendancy. Mr. Kendal
      asking her, got little in reply but such a grunt, that Mrs. Ferrars longed
      to shake her, but her father fetched a footstool, and put it under her
      feet, and grew a little abstracted in his talk, as if watching her, and
      his eye had something of the old habitual melancholy.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it went on. The night&rsquo;s rest did not carry off the temper. Sophy was
      monosyllabic, displeased if not attended to, but receiving attention like
      an affront, wanting nothing, but offended if it were not offered. Albinia
      was exceedingly grieved. She had some suspicion that Sophy might have been
      hurt by her going to Mrs. Ferrars instead of to her on their return from
      church, and made an attempt at an apology, but this was snubbed like an
      additional affront, and she could only bide the time, and be greatly
      disappointed at such an exhibition before the guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      Winifred looked on, forbearing to hurt Albinia&rsquo;s feelings by remarks, but
      in private compensating by little outbreaks with her husband, teasing him
      about his hopeful goddaughter, laughing at Albinia&rsquo;s infatuation, and
      railing at Mr. Kendal&rsquo;s endurance of the ill-humour, which she declared he
      promoted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maurice, as usual, was provoking. He had no notion of giving up his
      godchild, he said, and he had no doubt that Edmund Kendal could manage his
      own child his own way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because of his great success in that line.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is not what he was. He uses his sense and principle now, and when they
      are fairly brought to bear, I know no one whom I would more entirely
      trust.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well! it will be great good luck if I do not fall foul of Miss Sophy one
      of these days, if no one else will!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Winifred was slightly irritable herself from weakness, and on the last
      morning of her stay she could bear the sight no longer. Sophy had twice
      been surly to Lucy&rsquo;s good offices, had given Albinia a look like thunder,
      and answered her father with a sulky displeasure that made Mrs. Ferrars
      exclaim, as soon as he had left the room, &lsquo;I should never allow a child of
      mine to peak to her father in that manner!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy swelled. She did not think Mrs. Ferrars had any right to interfere
      between her and her father. Her silence provoked Winifred to continue, &lsquo;I
      wonder if you have any compunction for having spoilt all your&mdash;all
      Mrs. Kendal&rsquo;s enjoyment of our visit.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am not of consequence enough to spoil any one&rsquo;s pleasure.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      That was the last effort. Albinia came into the room, with little Maurice
      holding her hand, and flourishing a whip. He trotted up to the sofa, and
      began instantly to &lsquo;whip sister Sophy;&rsquo; serve her right, if I had but the
      whip, thought Mrs. Ferrars, as his mother hurried to snatch him off.
      Leaning over Sophy&rsquo;s averted face, she saw a tear under her eyelashes, but
      took no notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three seconds after, Sophy reared herself up, and with a rigid face and
      slow step walked out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you said anything to her?&rsquo; asked Albinia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I could not help it,&rsquo; said Winifred, narrating what had past. &lsquo;Have I
      done wrong?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Edmund cannot bear to have anything harsh said to her in these moods,
      especially about her behaviour to himself. He thinks she cannot help it&mdash;but
      it may be well that she should know how it appears to other people, for I
      cannot bear to see his patient kindness spurned. Only, you know, she
      values it in her heart. I am afraid we shall have a terrible agony now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia was right. It was the worst agony poor Sophy had ever undergone.
      She had been all this time ignorant that it was a cross fit, only
      imagining herself cruelly neglected and cast aside for the sake of Mrs.
      Ferrars; but the wakening time had either arrived, or had been brought by
      that reproach, and she beheld her conduct in the most abhorrent light.
      After having desired to be pledged to her share of the covenant, and
      earnestly longed to bear the cross, to be sworn in as soldier and servant,
      to have put her neck under the yoke of her old master ere the cross had
      dried upon her brow, to have been meanly jealous, ungrateful,
      disrespectful, vindictive!! oh! misery, misery! hopeless misery! She would
      take no word of comfort when Albinia tried to persuade her that it had
      been partly the reaction of a mind wrought up to an occasion very simple
      in its externals, and of a body fatigued by exertion; and then in
      warm-hearted candour professed that she herself had been thoughtless in
      neglecting Sophy for Winifred. Still less comfort would she take in her
      father&rsquo;s free forgiveness, and his sad entreaties that she would not treat
      these fits of low spirits as a crime, for they were not her fault, but
      that of her constitution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then one can&rsquo;t help being hateful and wicked! Nothing is of any use! I
      had rather you had told me I was mad!&rsquo; said poor Sophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was so spent and exhausted with weeping, that she could not come down&mdash;indeed,
      between grief and nervousness she would not eat; and Albinia found Mr.
      Kendal mournfully persuading her, when a stern command would have done
      more good. Albinia spoke it: &lsquo;Sophy, you have put your father to a great
      deal of pain already; if you are really grieving over it, you will not
      hurt him more by making yourself ill.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The strong will came into action on the right side, and Sophy sat up, took
      what was offered, but what was she that they should care for her, when she
      had spoilt mamma&rsquo;s pleasure? Better go and be happy with Mrs. Ferrars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy&rsquo;s next visitor came up with a manly tread, and she almost feared
      that she had made herself ill enough for the doctor; but it was Mr.
      Ferrars, with a kind face of pitying sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;May I come to wish my godchild good-bye?&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy did not speak, and he looked compassionately at the prone dejection
      of the whole figure, and the pale, sallow face, so piteously mournful. He
      took her hand, and began to tell her of the godfather&rsquo;s present, that he
      had brought her&mdash;a little book of devotions intended for the time
      when she should be confirmed. Sophy uttered a feeble &lsquo;thank you,&rsquo; but a
      hopeless one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! you are feeling as if nothing would do you any good,&rsquo; said Mr.
      Ferrars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Papa says so!&rsquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not quite,&rsquo; said Mr. Ferrars. &lsquo;He knows that your low spirits are the
      effect of temperament and health, and that you are not able to prevent
      yourself from feeling unhappy and aggrieved. And perhaps you reckoned on
      too much sensible effect from Church ordinances. Now joy, help, all these
      blessings are seldom revealed to our consciousness, but are matters of
      faith; and you must be content to work on in faith in the dark, before you
      feel comfort. I cannot but hope that if you will struggle, even when you
      are hurt and annoyed, to avoid the expression of vexation, the morbid
      temper will wear out, and you will both be tempted and suffer less, as you
      grow older. And, Sophy&mdash;forgive me for asking&mdash;do you pray in
      this unhappy state?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I cannot. It is not true.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Make it true. Take some verse of a Psalm. Shall I mark you some? Repeat
      them, even if you seem to yourself not to feel them. There is a holy power
      that will work on you at last; and when you can truly pray, the dark hour
      will pass.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mark them,&rsquo; said Sophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was some space, while she gave him the book, and he showed her the
      verses. Then he rose to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish I had not spoilt the visit,&rsquo; she said, wistfully, at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We shall see you again, and we shall know each other better,&rsquo; he said,
      kindly. &lsquo;You are my godchild now, Sophy, and you know that I must remember
      you constantly in prayer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; she faintly said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And will you promise me to try my remedy? I think it will soften your
      heart to the graces of the Blessed Comforter. And even if all seems gloom
      within, look out, see others happy, try to rejoice with them, and peace
      will come in! Now, goodbye, my dear godchild, and the God of Peace bless
      you, and give you rest.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Dusautoy had given notice of the day of the Confirmation, when Mr.
      Kendal called his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wonder,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;my dear, whether Sophia can spare you to take a walk
      with me before church.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy, who was well aware that a walk with him was the greatest and rarest
      treat to his wife, gave gracious permission, and in a few minutes they
      were walking by the bright canal-side, under the calm evening sunshine and
      deep blue sky of early autumn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kendal said not a word, and Albinia, leaning on his arm, listened, as
      it were, to the stillness, or rather to the sounds that marked it&mdash;the
      gurgling of the little streams let off into the water-courses in the
      meadows; the occasional plunge of the rat from the banks, the sounds from
      the town, softened by distance, and the far-off cawings of the rooks,
      which she could just see wheeling about as little black specks over the
      plantations of Woodside, or watching the swallows assembling for departure
      sitting in long ranks, like an ornament along the roof of a neighbouring
      barn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long, long it was before Mr. Kendal broke silence, but when at length he
      did speak, his words amazed her extremely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Albinia, poor Sophia&rsquo;s admission into the Church has not been the only
      neglect. I have never been confirmed. I intend to speak to Dusautoy this
      evening, but I thought you would wish to know it first.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you. I suppose you went out to India too young.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor Maria says truly that no one thought of these things in our day, at
      least so far as we were concerned. I must explain to you, Albinia, how it
      is that I see things very differently now from the light in which I once
      viewed them. I was sent home from India, at six years old, to
      correspondents and relations to whom I was a burthen. I was placed at a
      private school, where the treatment was of the harsh style so common in
      those days. The boys always had more tasks than they could accomplish, and
      were kept employed by being always in arrears with their lessons. This
      pressed less heavily upon me than on most; but though I seldom incurred
      punishment, there was a sort of hard distrust of me, I believe because the
      master could not easily overwhelm me with work, so as to have me in his
      power. I know I was often unjustly treated, and I never was popular.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I can imagine you extremely miserable.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You can understand my resolution that my boys should not be sent to
      England to be homeless, and how I judged all schools by my own experience.
      I stayed there too late, till I was beyond both tormentors and masters,
      and was left to an unlimited appetite for books, chiefly poetry. Our
      religious instruction was a nullity, and I am only surprised that the
      results were not worse. India was not likely to supply what education had
      omitted. Looking back on old journals and the like, I am astonished to see
      how unsettled my notions were&mdash;my sublimity, which was really
      ignorant childishness, and yet my perfect unconsciousness of my want of
      Christianity.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I dare say you cannot believe it was yourself, any more than I can. What
      brought other thoughts!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Practical obligations made me somewhat less dreamy, and my dear boy,
      Edmund, did much for me, but all so insensibly, that I can remember no
      marked change. I do not know whether you will understand me, when I say
      that I had attained to somewhat of what I should call personal religion,
      such as we often find apart from the Church.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But, Edmund, you always were a Churchman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was; but I viewed the Church merely as an establishment&mdash;human,
      not divine. I had learnt faith from Holy Scripture, from my boy, from the
      infants who passed away so quickly, and I better understood how to direct
      the devotional tendencies that I had never been without, but the
      sacramental system had never dawned on my comprehension, nor the real
      meaning of Christian fellowship. Thence my isolation.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You had never fairly seen the Church.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never. It might have made a great difference to me if Dusautoy had been
      here at the time of my trouble. When he did come, I had sunk into a state
      whence I could not rouse myself to understand his principles. I can hardly
      describe how intolerable my life had become. I was almost resolved on
      returning to India. I believe I should have done so if you had not come to
      my rescue.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What would you have done with the children?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To say the truth I had idolized their brother to such an exclusive
      degree, that I could not turn to the others when he was taken from me. I
      deserved to lose him; and since I have seen this unfortunate strain of
      melancholy developed in poor Sophia, who so much resembles him, I have
      been the more reconciled to his having been removed. I never understood
      what the others might be until you drew them out.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia paused, afraid to press his reserve too far; and the next thing
      she said was, &lsquo;I think I understand your distinction between personal
      religion and sacramental truth. It explains what has often puzzled me
      about good devout people who did not belong to the Church. The Visible
      Church cannot save without this individual personal religion but without
      having recourse to the Church, there is&mdash;&rsquo; she could not find the
      word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is a loss of external aid,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;nay, of much more. There is
      no certainty of receiving the benefits linked by Divine Power to her
      ordinances. Faith, in fact, while acknowledging the great Object of Faith,
      refuses or neglects to exercise herself upon the very subjects which He
      has set before her; and, in effect, would accept Him on her terms, not on
      His own.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was not refusal on your part,&rsquo; said Albinia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, it was rather indifference and imaginary superiority. But I have read
      and thought much of late, and see more clearly. If I thought of this rite
      of Confirmation at all, it was only as a means of impressing young minds.
      I now see every evidence that it is the completion of Baptismal grace, and
      without, like poor Sophia, expecting that effects would ever have been
      perceptible, I think that had I known how to seek after the Spirit of
      Counsel and Ghostly Strength, I might have given way less to the
      infirmities of my character, and have been less wilfully insensible to
      obvious duties.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you have made up your mind?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. I shall speak to Mr. Dusautoy at once.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And,&rsquo; she said, feeling for his sensitive shyness, &lsquo;no one else need know
      it&mdash;at least&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should not wish to conceal it from the children,&rsquo; he answered, with his
      scrupulous candour. He was supine when thought more ill of than he
      deserved, but he always defended himself from undeserved credit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Whom do you think I have for a candidate?&rsquo; said Mr. Dusautoy that
      evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Another now! I thought you were talking to Mr. Kendal about the onslaught
      on the Pringle pew.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you think of my churchwarden himself?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t mean that he has never been confirmed!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So he tells me. He went out to India young, and was never in the way of
      such things. Well, it will be a great example.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take care what you do. He will never endure having it talked of.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think he has made up his mind, and is above all nonsense. I am sure it
      is well that I need not examine him. I should soon get beyond my depth.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what good did his depth ever do to him,&rsquo; indignantly cried Mrs.
      Dusautoy, &lsquo;till that dear good wife of his took him in hand? Don&rsquo;t you
      remember what a log he was when first we came&mdash;how I used to say he
      gave you subscriptions to get rid of you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, well, Fanny, what&rsquo;s the use of recollecting all our foolish first
      impressions. I always told you he was the most able man in the parish.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fanny&rsquo; laughed merrily at this piece of sagacity, as she said &lsquo;Ay, the
      most able and the least practicable; and the best of it is, that his wife
      has not the most distant idea that she has been the making of him. She
      nearly quarrelled with me for hinting it. She would have it that &ldquo;Edmund&rdquo;
       had it all in him, and had only recovered his health and spirits.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And, indeed, it was no wonder she was happy. This step taken of free will
      by Mr. Kendal, was an evidence not only of a powerful reasoning intellect
      bowed to an act of simple faith but of a victory over the false shame that
      had always been a part of his nature. Nor did it apparently cost him as
      much as his consent to Sophy&rsquo;s admission into the Church; the first effort
      had been the greatest, and he was now too much taken up with deep thoughts
      of devotion to be sensitive as to the eyes and remarks of the world. The
      very resolution to bend in faithful obedience to a rite usually belonging
      to early youth and not obviously enforced to human reason, nor made an
      express condition of salvation, was as a pledge that he would strive to
      walk for the future in the path of self-denying obedience. Who that saw
      the manly well-knit form kneeling among the slight youthful ones around,
      and the thoughtful, sorrow-marked brow bowed down beneath the Apostolic
      hand, could doubt that such faith and such humble obedience would surely
      be endowed with a full measure of the Spirit of Ghostly Might, to lead him
      on in his battle with himself? Those young ones needed the &lsquo;sevenfold veil
      between them and the fires of youth,&rsquo; but surely the freshening and
      renewing came most blessedly to the man weary already with sin and woe,
      and tired out alike with himself and the world, because he had lived to
      himself alone.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Old Mr. Pringle never stirred beyond his parlour, and was invisible to
      every one, except his housekeeper and doctor, but his tall, square,
      curtained pew was jealously locked up, and was a grievance to the vicar,
      who having been foiled in several attempts, was meditating a fresh one,
      if, as he told his wife, he could bring his churchwarden up to the
      scratch, when one Sunday morning the congregation was electrified by the
      sound of a creak and a shake, and beheld a stout hale sunburnt gentleman,
      fighting with the disused door, and finally gaining the victory by
      strength of hand, admitting himself and a boy among the dust and the
      cobwebs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had Mr. Pringle, or rather his housekeeper, made a virtue of necessity?
      and if so, who could it be?
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia hailed the event as a fertile source of conjecture which might
      stave off dangerous subjects in the Sunday call, but there was no
      opportunity for any discussion, for Maria was popping about, settling and
      unsettling everything and everybody, in a state of greater confusion than
      ever, inextricably entangling her inquiries for Sophy with her
      explanations about the rheumatism which had kept grandmamma from church,
      and jumping up to pull down the Venetian blind, which descended awry, and
      went up worse. The lines got into such a hopeless complication, that
      Albinia came to help her, while Mr. Kendal stood dutifully by the fire, in
      the sentry-like manner in which he always passed that hour, bending now
      and then to listen and respond to some meek remark of old Mrs. Meadows,
      and now and then originating one. As to assisting Maria in any pother, he
      well knew that would be a vain act of chivalry, and he generally contrived
      to be insensible to her turmoils.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who could that have been in old Pringle&rsquo;s seat?&rsquo; he presently began,
      appropriating Albinia&rsquo;s cherished morsel of gossip; but he was not allowed
      to enjoy it, for Miss Meadows broke out,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, Edmund! this blind, I beg your pardon, but if you would help&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He was obliged to move to the window, and nervously clutching his arm, she
      whispered, &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll excuse it, I know, but don&rsquo;t mention it&mdash;not a
      word to mamma.&rsquo; Mr. Kendal looked at Albinia to gather what could be this
      dreadful subject, but the next words made it no longer doubtful. &lsquo;Ah, you
      were away, there&rsquo;s no use in explaining&mdash;but not a word of Sam
      Pringle. It would only make her uneasy&mdash;&rsquo; she gasped in a floundering
      whisper, stopping suddenly short, for at that moment the stranger and his
      son were entering the garden, so near them, that they might have seen the
      three pairs of eyes levelled on them, through the wide open end of the
      unfortunate blind, which was now in the shape of a fan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia&rsquo;s cheeks glowed with sympathy, and she longed for the power of
      helping her, marvelling how a being so nervously restless and devoid of
      self-command could pass through a scene likely to be so trying. The bell
      sounded, and the loud hearty tones of a manly voice were heard. Albinia
      looked to see whether her help were needed, but Miss Meadows&rsquo;s whole face
      was brightened, and moving across the room with unusually even steps, she
      leant on the arm of her mother&rsquo;s chair, saying, &lsquo;Mamma, it is Captain
      Pringle. You remember Samuel Pringle? He settled in the Mauritius, you
      know, and he was at church this morning with his little boy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something piteous in the searching look of inquiry that Mrs.
      Meadows cast at her daughter&rsquo;s face, but Maria had put it aside with an
      attempt at a smile, as &lsquo;Captain Pringle&rsquo; was announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      He trod hard, and spoke loud, and his curly grizzled hair was thrown back
      from a bronzed open face, full of broad heartiness, as he walked in with
      outstretched hand, exclaiming, &lsquo;Well, and how do you do?&rsquo; shaking with all
      his might the hand that Maria held out. &lsquo;And how are you, Mrs. Meadows?
      You see I could not help coming back to see old friends.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Old friends are always welcome, sir,&rsquo; said the old lady, warmly. &lsquo;My son,
      Mr. Kendal, sir&mdash;Mrs. Kendal,&rsquo; she added, with a becoming
      old-fashioned movement of introduction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very glad to meet you,&rsquo; said the captain, extending to each such a hearty
      shake of the hand, that Albinia suspected he was taking her on trust for
      Maria&rsquo;s sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your little boy?&rsquo; asked Mrs. Meadows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ay&mdash;Arthur, come and make the most of yourself, my man,&rsquo; said he,
      thumping the shy boy on the back to give him courage. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve brought him
      home for his schooling&mdash;quite time, you see, though what on earth I&rsquo;m
      to do without him&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy looked miserable at the words. &lsquo;Ay, ay,&rsquo; continued his father,
      &lsquo;you&rsquo;ll do well enough. I&rsquo;m not afraid for you, master, but that you&rsquo;ll be
      happy as your father was before you, when once you have fellows to play
      with you. Here is Mr. Kendal will tell you so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an unfortunate appeal, but Mr. Kendal made the best of it, saying
      that his boy was very happy at his tutor&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A private tutor, eh?&rsquo; said the rough captain, &lsquo;I&rsquo;d not thought of that&mdash;neither
      home nor school. I had rather do it thoroughly, and trust to numbers to
      choose friends from, and be licked into shape.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor little Arthur looked as if the process would be severe; and by way of
      consolation, Mrs. Meadows suggested, a piece of cake. Maria moved to ring
      the bell. It was the first time she had stirred since the visitor came in,
      and he getting up at the same time, that she might not trouble herself,
      their eyes met. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m very glad to see you again,&rsquo; he exclaimed, catching
      hold of her hand for another shake; &lsquo;but, bless me! you are sadly altered!
      I&rsquo;m sorry to see you looking so ill.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We all grow old, you know,&rsquo; said Maria, endeavouring to smile, but half
      strangled by a tear, and looking at that moment as she might have done
      long ago. &lsquo;You find many changes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope you find Mr. Pringle pretty well,&rsquo; said Albinia, thinking this
      might be a relief, and accordingly, the kind-hearted captain began,
      ruefully to describe the sad alterations that time had wrought. Then he
      explained that he had had little correspondence with home, and had only
      landed three days since, so that he was ignorant of all Bayford tidings,
      and began asking after a multitude of old friends and acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Kendals thought all would go on the better in their absence, and
      escaped from the record of deaths and marriages, each observing to the
      other as they left the house, that there could be little doubt that
      nurse&rsquo;s story was true, but both amazed by the effect on Maria, who had
      never been seen before to sit so long quiet in her chair. Was his wife
      alive? Albinia thought not, but could not be certain. His presence was
      evidently happiness to Miss Meadows, but would this last? Would this
      renewal soothe her, or only make her more restless and unhappy?
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia found that Sophy&rsquo;s imagination bad been quicker than her own. Lucy
      had brought home the great news of the stranger, and she had leapt at once
      to the conclusion that it must be the hero of nurse&rsquo;s story, but she had
      had the resolution to keep the secret from her sister, who was found
      reproaching her with making mysteries. When Lucy heard that it was Captain
      Pringle, she was quite provoked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only Mr. Pringle&rsquo;s nephew?&rsquo; she said, disdainfully. &lsquo;What was the use of
      making a fuss? I thought it was some one interesting!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy was able to walk to church in the evening, but was made to go in to
      rest at the vicarage before returning home. While this was being discussed
      before the porch, Albinia felt a pressure on her arm, and looking round,
      saw Maria Meadows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can you spare me a few moments?&rsquo; she said; and Albinia turned aside with
      her to the flagged terrace path between the churchyard and vicarage
      garden, in the light of a half-moon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You were so kind this morning,&rsquo; began Maria, &lsquo;that I thought&mdash;you
      see it is very awkward&mdash;not that I have any idea&mdash;but if you
      would speak to Edmund&mdash;I know he is not in the habit&mdash;morning
      visits and&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you wish him to call? He had been thinking of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Maria would have been unbounded in her gratitude, but catching herself up,
      she disclaimed all personal interest&mdash;only she said Edmund knew
      nothing of anything that had passed&mdash;if he did, he would see they
      would feel&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think,&rsquo; said Albinia, kindly, &lsquo;that we do know that you had some
      troubles on that score. Old nurse said something to Sophy, but no other
      creature knows it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; exclaimed Maria, &lsquo;that is what comes of trusting any one. I was so
      ill when I found out how it had been, that I could not keep it from nurse,
      but from mamma I did&mdash;my poor father being just gone and all&mdash;I
      could not have had her know how much I felt it&mdash;the discovery I mean&mdash;and
      it is what I wish her never to do. But oh! Mrs. Kendal, think what it was
      to find out that when I had been thinking he had been only trifling with
      me all those years, to find that he had been so unkindly treated. There
      was his own dear letter to me never unsealed; and there was another to my
      father saying in a proud-spirited way that he did not know what he had
      done to be so served, and he wished I might find happiness, for I would
      never find one that loved me as well. I who had turned against him in my
      heart!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was cruel indeed! And you kept it from your mother!&rsquo; said Albinia,
      beginning to honour her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My poor father was just gone, you know, and I could not be grieving her
      with what was passed and over, and letting her know that my father had
      broken my heart, as indeed I think he did, though he meant it all for the
      best. But oh! I thought it hard when Lucy had married the handsomest man
      in the country, and gone out to India, without a word against it, that I
      might not please myself, because I was papa&rsquo;s favourite.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was very hard not to be made aware of his intentions.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yea,&rsquo; said Maria; &lsquo;for it gave me such a bitter, restless feeling against
      him&mdash;though I ought to have known him better than to think he would
      give one minute&rsquo;s pain he could help; and then when I knew the truth, the
      bitterness all went to poor papa&rsquo;s memory, and yet perhaps he never meant
      to be unkind either.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia said some kind words, and Maria went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But what I wanted to say was this&mdash;Please don&rsquo;t let mamma suspect
      one bit about it; and next, if Edmund would not mind showing him a little
      attention. Do you think he would, my dear? I do so wish that he should not
      think we were hurt by his marriage, and you see, two lone women can do
      nothing to make it agreeable; besides that, it would not be proper.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is his wife living?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear, I could not make up my tongue to ask&mdash;the poor dear boy
      there and all&mdash;but it is all the same. I hope she is, for I would not
      see him unhappy, and you don&rsquo;t imagine I have any folly in my head&mdash;oh,
      no! for I know what a fright the fret and the wear of this have made me;
      and besides, I never could leave mamma. So I trust his wife is living to
      make him happy, and I shall be more at peace now I have seen him again,
      since he turned his horse at Bobble&rsquo;s Leigh, and said I should soon hear
      from him again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed I think you will be happier. There is something very soothing in
      taking up old feelings and laying them to rest. I hope even now there is
      less pain than pleasure.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t help it,&rsquo; said Maria. &lsquo;I do hope it is not wrong; but his very
      voice has got the old tone in it, as if it were the old lullaby that my
      poor heart has been beating for all these years.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Who would have thought of Maria speaking poetically? But her words did
      indeed seem to be the truth. In spite of the embarrassment of her
      situation and the flutter of her feelings, she was in a state of composure
      unexampled. Albinia had just gratified her greatly by a few words on
      Captain Pringle&rsquo;s evident good-nature, when a tread came behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ha! you here?&rsquo; exclaimed the loud honest voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We were taking a turn in the moonlight,&rsquo; said Albinia. &lsquo;A beautiful
      night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Beautiful! Arthur and I have been a bit of the way home with old
      Goldsmith. There&rsquo;s an evergreen, to be sure; and now&mdash;are you bound
      homewards, Maria?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Maria clung to Albinia&rsquo;s arm. Perhaps in the days of the last parting, she
      had been less careful to be with a chaperon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! I forgot,&rsquo; said the captain; &lsquo;your way lies the other side of the
      hill. I had very nearly walked into Willow Lawn this morning, only luckily
      I bethought me of asking.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope you will yet walk into Willow Lawn,&rsquo; said Albinia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! thank you; I should like to see the old place. I dare say it may be
      transmogrified now, but I think I could find my way blindfold about the
      old garden. I say, Maria, do you remember that jolly tea-party on the
      lawn, when the frog made one too many?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That I do&mdash;&rsquo; Maria could not utter more, and Albinia said she was
      afraid he would miss a great deal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I reckoned on that when I came home. Changes everywhere; but after the
      one great change,&rsquo; he added, mournfully, &lsquo;the others tell less. One has
      the less heart to care for an old tree or an old path.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia felt sure he could mean only one great change, but they were now
      at Mrs. Meadows&rsquo;s door, and Maria wished them good night, giving a most
      grateful squeeze of the hand to Mrs. Kendal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where are you bound now?&rsquo; asked the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Back to the vicarage, to take up my husband and the girls,&rsquo; said Albinia,
      &lsquo;but good night. I am not afraid.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain, however, chose to continue a squire of dames, and walked at
      her side, presently giving utterance to a sound of commiseration. &lsquo;Ah!
      well, poor Maria, I never thought to see her so altered. Why, she had the
      prettiest bloom&mdash;I dare say you remember&mdash;but, I beg your
      pardon, somehow I thought you were her <i>elder</i> sister.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Kendal&rsquo;s first wife was,&rsquo; said Albinia, pitying the poor man; but
      Captain Pringle was not a man for awkwardness, and the short whistle with
      which he received her answer set her off laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I beg your pardon,&rsquo; he said, recovering himself; &lsquo;but you see I am all
      astray, like a man buried and dug up again, so no wonder I make strange
      blunders; and my poor uncle is grown so childish, that he does not know
      one person from another, and began by telling me Maria Meadows had married
      and gone out to India. I had not had a letter these seven years, so I
      thought it was high time to bring my boy home, and renew old times, though
      how I am ever to go back without him&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is he your only one?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. I lost his mother when he was six years old, and we have been all
      the world to each other since, till I began to think I was spoiling him
      outright, and it was time he should see what Old England was made of.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia had something like a discovery to impart now; but she hated the
      sense of speculating on the poor man&rsquo;s intentions. He talked so much, that
      he saved her trouble in replying, and presently resumed the subject of
      Maria&rsquo;s looks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She has had a harassed life, I fear,&rsquo; said Albinia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Eh! old Meadows was a terrible old tyrant, I believe; but she was his
      pet. I thought he refused her nothing&mdash;but there&rsquo;s no trusting such a
      Turk! Oh! ah! I dare say,&rsquo; as if replying to something within. And then
      having come to the vicarage wicket, Albinia took leave of him and ran
      indoors, answering the astonished queries as to how she had been employed,
      &lsquo;Walking home with Aunt Maria and Captain Pringle!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was rather a relief at such a juncture that Lucy&rsquo;s curious eyes should
      be removed. Mr. Ferrars came to talk his wife&rsquo;s state over with his
      sister. Her children were too much for Winifred, and he wished to borrow
      Lucy for a few weeks, till a governess could be found for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It struck Albinia that this would be an excellent thing for Genevieve
      Durant, and she at once contrived to ask her to tea, and privately
      propound the plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Genevieve faltered much of thanks, and said that Madame was very good; but
      the next morning a note was brought in, which caused a sudden change of
      countenance:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear Madame,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was so overwhelmed with your kindness last night, and so unwilling to
      appear ungrateful, that perhaps I left you under a false impression. I
      entreat you not to enter on the subject with my grandmamma or my aunt.
      They would grieve to prevent what they would think for my advantage, and
      would, I am but too sure, make any sacrifice on my account; but they are
      no longer young, and though my aunt does not perceive it, I know that the
      real work of the school depends on me, and that she could not support the
      fatigue if left unassisted. They need their little Genevieve, likewise, to
      amuse them in their evenings; and, forgive me, madame, I could not,
      without ingratitude, forsake them now. Thus, though with the utmost sense
      of your kindness, I must beg of you to pardon me, and not to think me
      ungrateful if I decline the situation so kindly offered to me by Mr.
      Ferrars, thanking you ten thousand times for your too partial
      recommendation, and entreating you to pardon
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your most grateful and humble servant,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;GENEVIEVE CELESTE DURANT.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There!&rsquo; said Albinia, tossing the note to her brother, who was the only
      person present excepting Gilbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor Albinia,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;it is hard to be disappointed in a bit of
      patronage.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never meant it as patronage,&rsquo; said Albinia, slightly hurt. &lsquo;I thought
      it would help you, and rescue her from that school. There will she spend
      the best years of her life in giving a second-rate education to third-rate
      girls, not one of whose parents can appreciate her, till she will grow as
      wizened and as wooden as Mademoiselle herself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Happily,&rsquo; said Mr. Ferrars, &lsquo;there are worse things than being spent in
      one&rsquo;s duty. She may be doing an important work in her sphere.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So does a horse in a mill,&rsquo; exclaimed Albinia; &lsquo;but you would not put a
      hunter there. Yes, yes, I know, education, and these girls wanting right
      teaching; but she, poor child, has been but half educated herself, and has
      not time to improve herself. If she does good, it is by force of sheer
      goodness, for they all look down upon her, as much as vulgarity can upon
      refinement.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I told her so,&rsquo;, exclaimed Gilbert; &lsquo;I told her it was the only way to
      teach them what she was worth.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What did you know of the matter?&rsquo; asked Albinia; and the colour mounted
      in the boy&rsquo;s face as he muttered, &lsquo;She was overcome when she came down,
      she said you had been so kind, and we were obliged to walk up and down
      before she could compose herself, for she did not want the old ladies to
      know anything about it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And did she not wish to go?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, though I did the best I could. I told her what a jolly place it was,
      and that the children would be a perfect holiday to her. And I showed her
      it would not be like going away, for she might come over here whenever she
      pleased; and when I have my horse, I would come and bring her word of the
      old ladies once a week.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Inducements, indeed!&rsquo; said Mr. Ferrars. &lsquo;And she could not be incited by
      any of these?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Gilbert, &lsquo;she would not hear of leaving the old women. She was
      only afraid it would vex Mrs. Kendal, and she could not bear not to take
      the advice of so kind a friend, she said. You are not going to be angry
      with her,&rsquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Albinia, &lsquo;one cannot but honour her motives, though I think she
      is mistaken; and I am sorry for her; but she knows better than to be
      afraid of me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With which assurance Gilbert quitted the room, and the next moment,
      hearing the front door, she exclaimed, &lsquo;I do believe he is gone to tell
      her how I took the announcement.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Maurice gave a significant &lsquo;Hem!&rsquo; to which his sister replied, &lsquo;Nonsense!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very romantic consolations and confidences.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not at all. They have been used to each other all their lives, and he
      used to be the only person who knew how to behave to her, so no wonder
      they are great friends. As to anything else, she is nineteen, and he not
      sixteen.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One great use of going to school is to save lads from that silly pastime.
      I advise you to look to these moonlight escortings!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One would think you were an old dowager, Maurice. I suppose Colonel Bury
      may not escort Miss Mary.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, Albinia, you are a very naughty child still.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course, when you are here to keep me in order, I wish I never were so
      at other times when it is not so safe.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kendal was kind and civil to Captain Pringle, and though the
      boisterous manner seemed to affect him like a thunderstorm, Maria imagined
      they were delighted with one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maria was strangely serene and happy; her querulous, nervous manner
      smoothed away, as if rest had come to her at last; and even if the renewed
      intercourse were only to result in a friendship, there was hope that the
      troubled spirit had found repose now that misunderstandings were over, and
      the sore sense of ill-usage appeased.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet Albinia was startled when one day Mr. Kendal summoned her, saying, &lsquo;It
      is all over, she has refused him!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Impossible; she could only have left half her sentence unsaid.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Too certain. She will not leave her mother.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is that all?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course it is. He told me the whole affair, and certainly Mr. Meadows
      was greatly to blame. He let Maria give this man every encouragement,
      believing his property larger, and his expectations more secure than was
      the case; and when the proposal was made, having discovered his mistake,
      he sent a peremptory refusal, giving him reason to suppose her a party to
      the rejection. Captain Pringle sailed in anger; but it appears that his
      return has revived his former feelings, and that he has found out that
      poor Maria was a greater sufferer than himself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why does he come to you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To consult me. He wishes me to persuade poor old Mrs. Meadows to go out
      to the Mauritius, which is clearly impossible, but Maria must not be
      sacrificed again. Would the Drurys make her comfortable? Or could she not
      live alone with her maid?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She might live here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Albinia! Think a little.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can think of nothing else. Let her have the morning room, and Sophy&rsquo;s
      little room, and Lucy and I would do our best for her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, that is out of the question. I would not impose such charge upon you
      on any consideration!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia&rsquo;s face became humble and remorseful. &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;perhaps I
      am too impatient and flighty.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That was not what I meant,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;but I do not think it right that a
      person with no claims of relationship should be made a burthen on you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No claims, Edmund,&rsquo; said she, softly. &lsquo;In whose place have you put me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He was silent: then said, &lsquo;No, it must not be, my kind Albinia. She is a
      very good old lady, but Sophy and she would clash, and I cannot expose the
      child to such a trial.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I dare say you are right,&rsquo; pensively said Albinia, perceiving that her
      plan had been inconsiderate, and that it would require the wisdom, tact,
      and gentleness of a model woman to deal with such discordant elements.
      &lsquo;What are you going to do?&rsquo; as he took up his hat. &lsquo;Are you going to see
      Maria? May I come with you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you please; but do not mention this notion. There is no necessity for
      such a tax on you; and such arrangement should never be rashly made.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He asked whether Miss Meadows could see him, and awaited her alone in the
      dining-room, somewhat to the surprise of his wife; but either he felt that
      there was a long arrear of kindness owing, or feared to trust Albinia&rsquo;s
      impulsive generosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime Albinia found the poor old lady in much uneasiness and distress.
      Her daughter fancied it right to keep her in ignorance of the crisis; but
      Maria was not the woman to conceal her feelings, and her nervous misery
      had revealed all that she most wished to hide. Too timid to take her
      confidence by storm, her mother had only exchanged surmises and
      observations with Betty, and was in a troubled condition of affectionate
      curiosity and anxiety. Albinia was a welcome visitor since it was a great
      relief to hear what had really taken place and to know that Mr. Kendal was
      with Maria.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! that is kind,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;but he must tell her not to think of me. I
      am an old woman, good for nothing but to be put out of the way, and she
      has gone through quite enough! You will not let her give it up! Tell her I
      have not many more years to live, and anything is good enough for me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That would hardly comfort her,&rsquo; said Albinia, affectionately; &lsquo;but
      indeed, dear grandmamma, I hope we shall convince her that we can do
      something to supply her place.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! my dear, you are very kind, but nobody can be like a daughter! But
      don&rsquo;t tell Maria so&mdash;poor dear love&mdash;she may never have another
      chance. Such a beautiful place out there, and Mr. Pringle&rsquo;s property must
      come to him at last! Bless me, what will Sarah Drury say? And such a good
      attentive man&mdash;besides, she never would hear of any one else&mdash;her
      poor papa never knew&mdash;Oh! she must have him! it is all nonsense to
      think of me! I only wish I was dead out of the way!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a strong mixture of unselfish love, and fear of solitude; of the
      triumph of marrying a daughter, and dread of separation; of affection, and
      of implanted worldliness; touching Albinia at one moment, and paining her
      at another; but she soothed and caressed the old lady, and was a willing
      listener to what was meant for a history of the former transaction; but as
      it started from old Mr. Pringle&rsquo;s grandfather, it had only proceeded as
      far as the wedding of the Captain&rsquo;s father and mother, when it was broken
      off by Mr. Kendal&rsquo;s entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! my dear Mr. Kendal, and what does poor Maria say? It is so kind in
      you. I hope you have taken her in hand, and told her it is quite another
      thing now, and her poor dear papa would think so. She must not let this
      opportunity pass, for she may never have another. Did you tell her so?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I told her that, under the circumstances, she has no alternative but to
      accept Captain Pringle.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! thank you. And does she?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She has given me leave to send him to her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am so much obliged. I knew that nobody but you could settle it for her,
      poor dear girl; she is so young and inexperienced, and one is so much at a
      loss without a gentleman. But this is very kind; I did not expect it in
      you, Mr. Kendal. And will you see Mr. Pettilove, and do all that is proper
      about settlements, as her poor dear papa would have done. Poor Pettilove,
      he was once very much in love with Maria!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In this mood of triumph and felicity, the old lady was left to herself and
      her daughter. Albinia, on the way home, begged to hear how Mr. Kendal had
      managed Maria; and found that he had simply told her, in an authoritative
      tone, that after all that had passed, she had no choice but to accept
      Captain Pringle, and that he had added a promise, equally vague and
      reassuring, of being a son to Mrs. Meadows. Such injunctions from such a
      quarter had infused new life into Maria; and in the course of the
      afternoon, Albinia met the Captain with the mother and daughter, one on
      each arm, Maria in recovered bloom and brilliancy, and Mrs. Meadows&rsquo;s
      rheumatism forgotten in the glory of exhibiting her daughter engaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      For form&rsquo;s sake, secrecy had been mentioned; but the world of Bayford had
      known of the engagement a fortnight before took place. Sophy had been
      questioned upon it by Mary Wolfe two hours ere she was officially
      informed, and was sore with the recollection of her own ungracious
      professions of ignorance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So it is true,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t mind, since Arthur is not a girl.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kendal laughed so heartily, that Sophy looked to Albinia for
      explanation; but even on the repetition of her words, she failed to
      perceive anything ridiculous in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, mamma,&rsquo; she said, impressively, &lsquo;if you had been like Aunt Maria, I
      should&mdash;&rsquo; she paused and panted for sufficient strength of phrase&mdash;&lsquo;I
      should have run away and begged! Papa laughs, but I am sure he remembers
      when grandmamma and Aunt Maria wanted to come and live here!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked as if he remembered it only too well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, papa,&rsquo; pursued Sophy, &lsquo;we heard the maids saying that they knew it
      would not do, for all Mr. Kendal was so still and steady, for Miss Meadows
      would worret the life out of a lead pincushion.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hem!&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal. &lsquo;Albinia, do you think after all we are doing
      Captain Pringle any kindness?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is the best judge.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nay, he may think himself bound in honour and compassion&mdash;he may be
      returning to an old ideal.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;People like Captain Pringle are not apt to have ideals,&rsquo; said Albinia;
      &lsquo;nor do I think Maria will be so trying. Do you remember that creeper of
      Lucy&rsquo;s, all tendrils and catching leaves, which used to lie sprawling
      about, entangling everything till she gave it a prop, when it instantly
      found its proper development, and offered no further molestation?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      All was not, however, smooth water as yet. The Captain invaded Mr. Kendal
      the next morning in despair at Maria having recurred to the impossibility
      of leaving her mother, and wanting him to wait till he could reside in
      England. This could not be till his son was grown up, and ten years were a
      serious delay. Mr. Kendal suspected her of a latent hope that the Captain
      would end by remaining at home; but he was a man sense and determination,
      who would have thought it unjustifiable weakness to sacrifice his son&rsquo;s
      interests and his own usefulness. He would promise, that if all were alive
      and well, he would bring Maria back in ten or twelve years&rsquo; time; but he
      would not sooner relinquish his duties, and he was very reluctant to
      become engaged on such terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No one less silly than poor Maria would have thought of such a proposal,&rsquo; 
      was Mr. Kendal&rsquo;s comment afterwards to his wife. &lsquo;Twelve years! No one
      would be able to live with her by that time!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I cannot help respecting the unselfishness,&rsquo; said Albinia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One sided unselfishness,&rsquo; quoth Mr. Kendal. &lsquo;I am sick of the whole
      business, I wish I had never interfered. I cannot get an hour to myself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He might be excused for the complaint on that day of negotiations and
      counter-negotiations, which gave no one any rest, especially after Mrs.
      Drury arrived with all the rights of a relation, set on making it evident,
      that whoever was to be charged with Mrs. Meadows, it was not herself; and
      enforcing that nothing could be more comfortable than that Lucy Kendal
      should set up housekeeping with her dear grandmamma. Every one gave
      advice, and nobody took it; Mrs. Meadows cried, Maria grew hysterical, the
      Captain took up his hat and walked out of the house; and Albinia thought
      it would be very good in him ever to venture into it again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning Mr. Kendal ordered his horse early, and hastened his
      breakfast; told Albinia not to wait dinner for him, and rode off by one
      gate, without looking behind him, as the other opened to admit Captain
      Pringle. She marvelled whither he had fled, and thought herself fortunate
      in having only two fruitless discussions in his absence. Not till eight
      o&rsquo;clock did he make his appearance, and then it was in an unhearing,
      unseeing mood, so that nothing could be extracted, except that he did not
      want any dinner; and it was not till late in the evening that he abruptly
      announced, &lsquo;Lucy is coming home on Wednesday. Colonel Bury will bring her
      to Woodside.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      What? have you heard from Maurice?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No; I have been at Fairmead.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      You! To-day! How was Winifred?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Better&mdash;I believe.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How does she like the governess?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I did not hear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Gradually something oozed out about Lucy having been happy and valuable,
      and after Sophy had gone to bed, he inquired how the courtship was going
      on?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Worse than ever,&rsquo; Albinia said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose it must end in this?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In what!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If there is no more satisfactory arrangement, I suppose we must receive
      Mrs. Meadows.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      If Albinia could but have heard what a scolding her brother was undergoing
      from his vivacious wife!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As if poor Albinia had not enough on her hands! Of all inmates in the
      world! When Mr. Kendal himself did not like it! Well! Maurice would
      certainly have advised Sinbad to request the honour of taking the Old Man
      of the Sea for a promenade a cheval. There was an end of Albinia. There
      would never be any room in her house, and she would never be able to come
      from home. And after having seen her worked to death, he to advise&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I did not advise, I only listened. What he came for was to silence his
      conscience and his wife by saying, &ldquo;Your brother thinks it out of the
      question.&rdquo; Now to this my conscience would not consent.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;More shame for it, then!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I could not say I thought these two people&rsquo;s happiness should be
      sacrificed, or the poor old woman left desolate. Albinia has spirits and
      energy for a worse infliction, and Edmund Kendal himself is the better for
      every shock to his secluded habits. If it is a step I would never dare
      advise, still less would I dare dissuade.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well! I thought Mr. Kendal at least had more sense.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ay, nothing is so provoking as to see others more unselfish than
      ourselves.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All I have to say,&rsquo; concluded Mrs. Ferrars, walking off, &lsquo;is, I wish
      there was a law against people going and marrying two wives.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia was in no haste to profit by her husband&rsquo;s consent to her
      proposal. The more she revolved it, the more she foresaw the discomfort
      for all parties. She made every effort to devise the &lsquo;more satisfactory
      arrangement,&rsquo; but nothing would occur. The Drurys would not help, and the
      poor old lady could not be left alone. Her maid Betty, who had become
      necessary to her comfort, was not a trustworthy person, and could not be
      relied on, either for honesty, or for not leaving her mistress too long
      alone; and when the notion was broached of boarding Mrs. Meadows with some
      family in the place, the conviction arose, that when she had
      grandchildren, there was no reason for leaving her to strangers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, the proposal was made, and as instantly rejected by Maria. It was
      very kind, but her mother could never be happy at Willow Lawn, never; and
      the tone betrayed some injury at such a thing being thought possible. But
      just as the Kendals had begun to rejoice at having cleared their
      conscience at so slight a cost, Captain Pringle and Miss Meadows made
      their appearance, and Maria presently requested that Mrs. Kendal would
      allow her to say a few words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am afraid you thought me very rude and ungrateful,&rsquo; she began, &lsquo;but the
      truth was, I did not think dear mamma would ever bear to live here, my
      poor dear sister and all; but since that, I have been talking it over with
      the dear Captain&mdash;thinks that since you are so kind, and dear Edmund&mdash;more
      than I could ever have dared to expect&mdash;that I could not do better
      than just to sound mamma.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was still another vicissitude. Mrs. Meadows would not hear of being
      thrust on any one, and was certain that Maria had extorted an invitation;
      she would never be a burden upon any one; young people liked company and
      amusement, and she was an old woman in every one&rsquo;s way; she wished she
      were in her coffin with poor dear Mr. Meadows, who would have settled it
      all. Maria fell back into the depths of despair, and all was lugubrious,
      till Mr. Kendal, in the most tender and gentle manner, expressed his hopes
      that Mrs. Meadows would consider the matter, telling her that his wife and
      children would esteem it a great privilege to attend on her, and that he
      should be very grateful if she would allow them to try to supply Maria&rsquo;s
      place. And Albinia, in her coaxing tone, described the arrangement; how
      the old furniture should stand in the sitting-room, and how Lucy would
      attend to her carpet-work, and what nice walks the sunny garden would
      afford, and how pleasant it would be not to have the long hill between
      them, till grandmamma forgot all her scruples in the fascination of that
      sweet face and caressing manner, she owned that poor old Willow Lawn
      always was like home, and finally promised to come. Before the evening was
      over the wedding-day was fixed.
    </p>
    <p>
      What Sophy briefly termed &lsquo;the fuss about Aunt Maria,&rsquo; had been so
      tedious, that it almost dispelled all poetical ideas of courtship. If
      Captain Pringle had been drowned at sea, and Aunt Maria pined herself into
      her grave, it would have been much more proper and affecting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy heard of the arrangement without remark, and quietly listened to
      Albinia&rsquo;s explanation that she was not to be sent up to the attics, but
      was to inhabit the spare room, which was large enough to serve her for a
      sitting-room. But in the evening Mr. Kendal happened in her absence to
      take up the book which she had been reading, and did not perceive at once
      on her entrance that she wanted it. When he did so, he yielded it with a
      few kind words of apology, but this vexation had been sufficient to bring
      down the thunder-cloud which had been lowering since the morning. There
      were no signs of clearance the next day; but Albinia had too much upon her
      hands to watch the symptoms, and was busy making measurements for the
      furniture in the morning-room when Mr. Kendal came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have been thinking,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;that it is a pity to disturb this room.
      I dare say Mrs. Meadows would prefer that below-stairs. It used to be her
      parlour, where she always sat when I first knew the house.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The dining-room? How could we spare that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, the study.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia remained transfixed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We could put the books here and in the dining-room,&rsquo; he continued, &lsquo;until
      next spring, when, as your brother said, we can build a new wing on the
      drawing-room side.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what is to become of you?&rsquo; she continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps you will admit me here,&rsquo; he said, smiling, for he was pleased
      with himself. &lsquo;Turn me out when I am in the way.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! Edmund, how delightful! See, we shall put your high desk under the
      window, and your chair in your own corner. This will be the pleasantest
      place in the house, with you and your books! Dear Winifred! she did me one
      of her greatest services when she made me keep this room habitable!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I think Sophy will not object to give up her present little room for
      my dressing-room. Shall you, my dear?&rsquo; said he, anxious to judge of her
      temper by her reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t care,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want any difference made to please me;
      I think that weak.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sophy!&rsquo; began Albinia, indignantly, but Mr. Kendal stopped her, and made
      her come down, to consider of the proposal in the study.
    </p>
    <p>
      That study, once an oppressive rival to the bride, now not merely
      vanquished, but absolutely abandoned by its former captive!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t say anything to her,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal, as they went downstairs. &lsquo;Of
      course her spirits are one consideration, but were it otherwise, I could
      not see you give up your private room.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is very kind in you, but indeed I can spare mine better than you can,&rsquo; 
      said Albinia. &lsquo;I am afraid you will never feel out of the whirl.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yours would be a loss to us all,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal. &lsquo;The more inmates
      there are in a house, the more needful to have them well assorted.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just so; and that makes me afraid&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of me? No, Albinia, I will try not to be a check on your spirits.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You! Oh! I meant that we should disturb you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You never disturb me, Albinia; and it is not what it was when the
      children&rsquo;s voices were untrained and unsubdued.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t say much for Master Maurice&rsquo;s voice.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled, he had never yet found those joyous notes de trop, and he
      continued, &lsquo;Your room is of value and use to us all; mine has been of
      little benefit to me, and none to any one else. I wish I could as easily
      leave behind me all the habits I have fostered there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Edmund, it is too good! When poor Sophy recovers her senses she will feel
      it, for I believe that morning room would have been a great loss to her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was too much to ask in her present state. I should have come to the
      same conclusion without her showing how much this plan cost her, for
      nothing can be plainer than that while she continues subject to these
      attacks, she must have some retreat.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yet,&rsquo; ventured Albinia, &lsquo;if you think solitude did you no good, do you
      think letting these fits have their swing is good for Sophy?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I <i>cannot</i> drive her about! They must not be harshly treated,&rsquo; he
      answered quickly. &lsquo;Resistance can only come from within; compulsion is
      worse than useless. Poor child, it is piteous to watch that state of dull
      misery! On other grounds, I am convinced this is the best plan. The
      communication with the offices will prevent that maid from being always on
      the stairs. Mrs. Meadows will have her own visitors more easily, and will
      get out of doors sooner, and I think she will be better pleased.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, it will be a much better plan for every one but Mr. Kendal himself,&rsquo; 
      said Albinia; &lsquo;and if he can be happy with us, we shall be all the
      happier. So this was the old sitting-room!&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes, I knew them first here,&rsquo; 
      he said. &lsquo;It used to be cheerful then, and I dare say you can make it the
      same again. We must dismantle it before Mrs. Meadows or Maria come to see
      it, or it will remind them of nothing but the days when I was recovering,
      and anything but grateful for their attention. Yes,&rsquo; he added, &lsquo;poor Mrs.
      Meadows bore most gently and tenderly with a long course of moroseness. I
      am glad to have it in my power to make any sort of amends, though it is
      chiefly through you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia might well be very happy! It was her moment of triumph, and
      whatever might be her fears for the future, and uneasiness at Sophy&rsquo;s
      discontent, nothing could take away the pleasure of finding herself
      deliberately preferred to the study.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy did not fail to make another protest, and when told that &lsquo;it was not
      solely on her account,&rsquo; the shame of having fancied herself so important,
      rendered her ill-humour still more painful and deplorable. It was vain to
      consult her about the arrangements, she would not care about anything,
      except that by some remarkable effect of her perverse condition, she had
      been seized with a penchant for maize colour and blue for the bridesmaids,
      and was deeply offended when Albinia represented that they would look like
      a procession of macaws, and her aunt declared that Sophy herself would be
      the most sacrificed by such colours. She made herself so grim that Maria
      broke up the consultation by saying good-humouredly, &lsquo;Yes, we will settle
      it when Lucy comes home.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; muttered Sophy, &lsquo;Lucy is ready for any sort of nonsense.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. and Mrs. Kendal went to Woodside to meet Lucy, hoping that solitude
      would be beneficial. Albinia grieved at the manifestations of these, her
      sullen fits, if only because they made Lucy feel herself superior. In
      truth, Lucy was superior in temper, amiability, and all the qualities that
      smooth the course of life, and it was very pleasant to greet her pretty
      bright face, so full of animation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear grandmamma going to live with us? Oh, how nice! I can always take
      care of her when you are busy, mamma.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      That accommodating spirit was absolute refreshment, and long before
      Albinia reached home the task of keeping the household contented seemed
      many degrees easier.
    </p>
    <p>
      A grand wedding was &lsquo;expected,&rsquo; so all the Bayford flys were bespoken
      three deep, a cake was ordered from Gunter, and so many invitations sent
      out, that Albinia speculated how all were to come alive out of the little
      dining-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Mr. Kendal the presiding gentleman!
    </p>
    <p>
      He had hardly seemed aware of his impending fate till the last evening,
      when, as the family were separating at night, he sighed disconsolately,
      and said, &lsquo;I am as bad as you are, Sophy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It awoke her first comfortable smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Experience had, however, shown him that such occasions might be survived,
      and he was less to be pitied than his daughter, who felt as if she and her
      great brown face would be the mark of all beholders. Poor Sophy! all
      scenes were to her like daguerreotypes in a bad light, she saw nothing but
      herself distorted!
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet she was glad that the period of anticipation had consumed itself
      and its own horrors, and found herself not insensible to the excitement of
      the occasion. Lucy was joyous beyond description, looking very pretty, and
      solicitously decorating her sister, while both bestowed the utmost rapture
      on their step-mother&rsquo;s appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having learnt at last what Bayford esteemed a compliment, she had
      commissioned her London aunts to send her what she called &lsquo;an
      unexceptionable garment,&rsquo; and so well did they fulfil their orders, that
      not only did her little son scream, &lsquo;Mamma, pretty, pretty!&rsquo; and Gilbert
      stand transfixed with admiration, but it called forth Mr. Kendal&rsquo;s first
      personal remark, &lsquo;Albinia, you look remarkably well;&rsquo; and Mrs. Meadows
      reckoned among the honours done to her Maria, that Mrs. Kendal wore a
      beautiful silk dress, and a lace bonnet, sent down on purpose from London!
    </p>
    <p>
      Maria Meadows made a very nice bride, leaning on her brother-in-law, and
      not more agitated than became her well. The haggard restless look had long
      been gone, repose had taken away the lean sharpness of countenance, the
      really pretty features had fair play, and she was astonishingly like her
      niece Lucy, and did not look much older. Her bridegroom was so beaming and
      benignant, that it might fairly be hoped that even if force of habit
      should bring back fretfulness, he had a stock of happiness sufficient for
      both. The chairs were jammed so tight round the table, that it was by a
      desperate struggle that people took their seats, and Mr. Dusautoy&rsquo;s
      conversation was a series of apologies for being unable to keep his elbows
      out of his neighbours&rsquo; way while carving, and poor Sophy, whose back was
      not two feet from the fire, was soon obliged to retreat. She had gained
      the door before any one perceived her, and then her brother and sister
      both followed; Albinia was obliged to leave her to their care, being in
      the innermost recesses, where moving was impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was not much the matter, she only wanted rest, and Gilbert undertook
      to see her safely home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall be heartily glad to get away,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;There is no breathing in
      there, and they&rsquo;ll begin talking the most intolerable nonsense presently.
      Besides, I want to be at home to take baby down to the gate to halloo at
      the four white horses from the King&rsquo;s Head. Come along, Sophy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mind you don&rsquo;t make her walk too fast,&rsquo; said the careful Lucy, &lsquo;and take
      care how you take off your muslin, Sophy, you had better go to the nursery
      for help.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert did not seem inclined to hurry his sister as they came near Madame
      Belmarche&rsquo;s. He lingered, and presently said, &lsquo;Should you be too tired to
      come in here for a moment? it was an intolerable shame that none of them
      were asked.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mamma did beg for Genevieve, but there was so little room, and the Drurys
      did not like it. Mrs. Drury said it would only be giving her a taste for
      things above her station.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then Mrs. Drury should never come out of the scullery. I am sure she
      looks as if her station was to black the kettles!&rsquo; cried Gilbert, with
      some domestic confusion in his indignation. &lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t she look like a
      housekeeper with her mistress&rsquo;s things on by mistake?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She did not look like mamma, certainly,&rsquo; said Sophy. &lsquo;Mamma looked no
      more aware that she had on those pretty things than if she had been in her
      old grey&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mamma&mdash;yes&mdash;Mrs. Drury might try seventy years to look like
      mamma, or Genevieve either! Put Genevieve into satin or into brown
      holland, you couldn&rsquo;t help her looking ten times more the lady than Mrs.
      Drury ever will! But come in, I have got a bit of the cake for them here,
      and they will like to see you all figged out, as they have missed all the
      rest of the show. Aunt Maria might have cared for her old mistress!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy wished to be amiable, and refrained from objecting.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a holiday in honour of cette chere eleve of five-and-twenty years
      since, and the present pupils were from their several homes watching for
      the first apparition of the four greys from the King&rsquo;s Head, with the
      eight white satin rosettes at their eight ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Belmarche and her daughter were discovered in the parlour, cooking
      with a stew pan over the fire a concoction which Sophy guessed to be a
      conserve of the rose-leaves yearly begged of the pupils, which were
      chiefly useful as serving to be boiled up at any leisure moment, to make a
      cosmetic for Mademoiselle&rsquo;s complexion. She had diligently used it these
      forty-five years, but the effect was not encouraging, as brown, wrinkled,
      with her frizzled front awry, with not stainless white apron, and a long
      pewter spoon, she turned round to confront the visitors in their wedding
      finery.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what Frenchwoman ever was disconcerted? Away went the spoon, forward
      she sprang, both hands outstretched, and her little black eyes twinkling
      with pleasure. &lsquo;Ah! but this is goodness itself,&rsquo; said she, in the English
      wherein she flattered herself no French idiom appeared. &lsquo;You are come to
      let us participate in your rejoicing. Let me but summon Genevieve, the
      poor child is at every free moment trying to perfectionnate her music in
      the school-room.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Belmarche had arisen to receive the guests with her dignified
      courtesy and heartfelt felicitations, which were not over when Genevieve
      tripped in, all freshness and grace, with her neat little collar, and the
      dainty black apron that so prettily marked her slender waist. One moment,
      and she had arranged a resting-place for Sophy, and as she understood
      Gilbert&rsquo;s errand, quickly produced from a corner-cupboard a plate, on
      which he handed it to the two other ladies, who meanwhile paid their
      compliments in the most perfect style.
    </p>
    <p>
      The history of the morning was discussed, and Madame Belmarche described
      her sister&rsquo;s wedding, and the curiosity which she had shared with the
      bride for the first sight of &lsquo;le futur,&rsquo; when the two sisters had been
      brought from their convent for the marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But how could she get to like him?&rsquo; cried Sophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My sister was too well brought up a young girl to acknowledge a
      preference,&rsquo; replied Madame Belmarche. &lsquo;Ah! my dear, you are English; you
      do not understand these things.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Sophy, &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t understand how people can marry without loving.
      How miserable they must be!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;On the contrary, my dear, especially if one continued to live with one&rsquo;s
      mother. It is far better to earn the friendship and esteem of a husband
      than to see his love grow cold.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And was your sister happy?&rsquo; asked Sophy, abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, my dear, never were husband and wife more attached. My brother-in-law
      joined the army of the Prince de Conde, and never was seen after the day
      of Valmy; and my sister pined away and died of grief. My daughter and
      granddaughter go to the Catholic burying-ground at Hadminster on her fete
      day, to dress her grave with immortelles.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Sophy knew why the strip of garden grew so many of the grey-leaved,
      woolly-stemmed, little yellow-and-white everlasting flowers. Good madame
      began to regret having saddened her on this day of joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! no,&rsquo; said Sophy, &lsquo;I like sad things best.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mais, non, my child, that is not the way to go through life,&rsquo; said the
      old lady, affectionately. &lsquo;Look at me; how could I have lived had I not
      always turned to the bright side? Do not think of sorrow, it, is always
      near enough.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This conversation had made an impression on Sophy, who took the first
      opportunity of expressing her indignation at the system of mariages de
      convenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And, mamma, she said if people began with love, it always grew cold. Now,
      has not papa loved you better and better every day?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia could not be displeased, though it made her blush, and she could
      not answer such a home push. &lsquo;We don&rsquo;t quite mean the same things,&rsquo; she
      said evasively. &lsquo;Madame is thinking of passion independent of esteem or
      confidence. But, Sophy, this is enough even for a wedding-day. Let us
      leave it off with our finery, and resume daily life.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only tell me one thing, mamma.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused and brought it out with an effort. It had evidently occupied
      her for a long time. &lsquo;Mamma, must not every one with feeling be in love
      once in their life?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well done, reserve!&rsquo; thought Albinia&mdash;&lsquo;but she is only a child,
      after all; not a blush, only those great eyes seeming ready to devour my
      answer. What ought it to be? Whatever it is, she will brood on it till her
      time comes. I must begin, or I shall grow nervous: &ldquo;Dear Sophy, these are
      not things good to think upon. There is quite enough to occupy a Christian
      woman&rsquo;s heart and soul without that&mdash;no need for her feelings to
      shrivel up for want of exercise. No, I don&rsquo;t believe in the passion once
      in the life being a fate, and pray don&rsquo;t you, my Sophy, or you may make
      yourself very silly, or very unhappy, or both.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy drew up her head, and her brown skin glowed. Albinia feared that she
      had said the wrong thing, and affronted her, but it was all working in the
      dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      At any rate the sullenness was dissipated, and there were no tokens of a
      recurrence. Sophy set herself to find ways of making amends for the past,
      and as soon as she had begun to do little services for grandmamma, she
      seemed to have forgotten her gloomy anticipations, even while some of them
      were partly realized. For as it would be more than justice to human nature
      to say that Mrs. Meadows&rsquo;s residence at Willow Lawn was a perfect success,
      so it would be less than justice to call it a failure.
    </p>
    <p>
      To put the darker side first. Grandmamma&rsquo;s interest in life was to know
      the proceedings of the whole household, and comment on each. Now Albinia
      could endure housewifely advice, some espionage on her servants, and even
      counsel about her child; but she could not away with the anxiety that
      would never leave Sophy alone, tried to force her sociability, and
      regretted all extra studies, unable to perceive the delicate treatment her
      disposition needed. And Sophy, in the intolerance of early girlhood, was
      wretched at hearing poor grandmamma&rsquo;s petty views, and narrow, ignorant
      prejudices. She might resolve to be filial and agreeable, but too often
      found herself just achieving a moody, disgusted silence, or else bursting
      out with some true but unbecoming reproof.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the whole, all did well. Mrs. Meadows was happy; she enjoyed the
      animation of the larger party, liked their cheerful faces, grew fond of
      Maurice, and daily more dependent on Lucy and Mrs. Kendal. Probably she
      had never before had so much of her own way, and her gentle placid nature
      was left to rest, instead of being constantly worried. Her son-in-law was
      kind and gracious, though few words passed between them, and he gave her a
      sense of protection. Indeed, his patience and good-humour were exemplary;
      he never complained even when he was driven from the dining-room by the
      table-cloth, to find Maurice rioting in the morning-room, and a music
      lesson in the drawing-room, or still worse, when he heard the Drurys
      everywhere; and he probably would have submitted quietly for the rest of
      his life, had not Albinia insisted on bringing forward the plan of
      building.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Captain and Mrs. Pringle returned to Bayford to take leave, they
      found grandmamma so thoroughly at home, that Maria could find no words to
      express her gratitude. Maria herself could hardly have been recognised,
      she had grown so like her husband in look and manner! If her sentences did
      not always come to their legitimate development, they no longer seemed
      blown away by a frosty wind, but pushed aside by fresh kindly impulses,
      and her pride in the Captain, and the rest in his support, had set her at
      peace with all the world and with herself. A comfortable, comely, happy
      matron was she, and even her few weeks beyond the precincts of Bayford had
      done something to enlarge her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was as if her education had newly begun. The fixed aim, and the union
      with a practical man, had opened her faculties, not deficient in
      themselves, but contracted and nipped by the circumstances which she had
      not known how to turn to good account. Such a fresh stage in middle life
      comes to some few, like the midsummer shoot to repair the foliage that has
      suffered a spring blight; but it cannot be reckoned on, and Mrs. Pringle
      would have been a more effective and self-possessed woman, a better
      companion to her husband, and with more root in herself, had Maria Meadows
      learnt to tune her nerves and her temper in the overthrow of her early
      hopes.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Maurice Ferrars was a born architect, with such a love of brick and
      mortar, that it was meritorious in him not to have overbuilt Fairmead
      parsonage. With the sense of giving him an agreeable holiday, his sister
      wrote to him in February that Gilbert&rsquo;s little attic was at his service if
      he would come and give his counsel as to the building project.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kendal disliked the trouble and disturbance as much as Maurice loved
      it; but he quite approved and submitted, provided they asked him no
      questions; he gave them free leave to ruin him, and set out to take Sophy
      for a drive, leaving the brother and sister to their calculations. Of
      ruin, there was not much danger, Mr. Kendal had a handsome income, and had
      always lived within it; and Albinia&rsquo;s fortune had not appeared to her a
      reason for increased expense, so there was a sufficient sum in hand to
      enable Mr. Ferrars to plan with freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      A new drawing-room, looking southwards, with bedrooms over it, was the
      matter of necessity; and Albinia wished for a bay-window, and would like
      to indulge Lucy by a conservatory, filling up the angle to the east with
      glass doors opening into the drawing-room and hall. Maurice drew, and she
      admired, and thought all so delightful, that she began to be taken with
      scruples as to luxury.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Maurice, &lsquo;these are not mere luxuries. You have full means, and
      it is a duty to keep your household fairly comfortable and at ease.
      Crowded as you are with rather incongruous elements, you are bound to give
      them space enough not to clash.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They don&rsquo;t clash, except poor Sophy. Gilbert and Lucy are elements of
      union, with more plaster of Paris than stone in their nature.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pray, has Kendal made up his mind what to do with Gilbert?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have heard nothing lately; I hope he is grown too old for India.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gilbert is rather too well off for his good,&rsquo; said Mr. Ferrars; &lsquo;the
      benefit of a profession is not evident enough.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know what I wish! If he could but be Mr. Dusautoy&rsquo;s curate, in five or
      six years&rsquo; time, what glorious things we might do with the parish!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Eh! is that his wish?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have sometimes hoped that his mind is taking that turn. He is ready to
      help in anything for the poor people. Once he told me he never wished to
      look beyond Bayford for happiness or occupation; but I did not like to
      draw him out, because of his father&rsquo;s plans. Why, what have you drawn? The
      alms-houses?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I could do no other when I was improving Gilbert&rsquo;s house for him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That would be the real improvement! How pretty! I will keep them for
      him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The second post came in, bringing a letter from Gilbert to his father, and
      Albinia was so much surprised, that her brother asked whether Gilbert were
      one of the boys who only write to their father with a reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He can write more freely to me,&rsquo; said Albinia; &lsquo;and it comes to the same
      thing. I am not in the least afraid of anything wrong, but perhaps he may
      be making some proposal for the future. I want to know how he is. Fancy
      his being so foolish as to go out bathing. I am afraid of his colds.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Many times during the consultation did Mr. Ferrars detect Albinia&rsquo;s eye
      stealing wistfully towards that &lsquo;E. Kendal, Esq.;&rsquo; and when the proper
      owner came in, he was evidently as much struck, for he paused, as if in
      dread of opening the letter. Her eyes were on his countenance as he read,
      and did not gather much consolation. &lsquo;I am afraid this is serious,&rsquo; at
      last he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;His cold?&rsquo; exclaimed Albinia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal, reading aloud sentence by sentence, with gravity
      and consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do not wish to alarm Mrs. Kendal, and therefore address myself at once
      to you, for I do not think it right to keep you in ignorance that I have
      had some of the old symptoms. I do not wish to make any one uneasy about
      me, and I may have made light of the cold I caught a month since; but I
      cannot conceal from myself that I have much painful cough, an inclination
      to shortness of breath, and pain in the back and shoulders, especially
      after long reading or writing. I thought it right to speak to Mr. Downton,
      but people in high health can understand nothing short of a raging fever;
      however, at last he called in the parish surgeon, a stupid, ignorant
      fellow, who understands my case no more than his horse, and treats me with
      hyoscyamus, as if it were a mere throat-cough. I thought it my duty to
      speak openly, since, though I am quite aware that circumstances make
      little difference in constitutional cases, I know you and dear Mrs. Kendal
      will wish that all possible means should be used, and I think it&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kendal broke down, and handed the letter to his wife, who proceeded,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think it best you should be prepared for the worst, as I wish and
      endeavour to be; and truly I see so much trial and disappointment in the
      course of life before me, that it would hardly be the worst to me, except&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      That sentence finished Albinia&rsquo;s voice, and stealing her hand into her
      husband&rsquo;s, she read on in silence,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;for the additional sorrow to you, and my grief at bringing pain to my
      more than mother, but she has long known of the presentiment that has
      always hung over me, and will be the better prepared for its realization.
      If it would be any satisfaction to you, I could easily take a ticket, and
      go up to London to see any physician you would prefer. I could go with
      Price, who is going for his sister&rsquo;s birthday, and I could sleep at his
      father&rsquo;s house; but, in that case, I should want three pounds journey
      money, and I should be very glad if you would be so kind as to let me have
      a sovereign in advance of my allowance, as Price knows of a capital
      secondhand bow and arrows. With my best love to all,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your affectionate son,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;GILBERT KENDAL.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia held the letter to her brother, to whom she looked for something
      cheering, but, behold! a smile was gaining uncontrollably on the muscles
      of his cheeks, though his lips strove hard to keep closely shut. She would
      not look at him, and turning to her husband, exclaimed, &lsquo;We will take him
      to London ourselves!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am afraid that would be inconvenient,&rsquo; observed Maurice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That would not signify,&rsquo; continued Albinia; &lsquo;I must hear myself what is
      thought of him, and how I am to nurse him. Oh! taking it in time, dear
      Edmund, we need not be so much afraid! Maurice will not mind making his
      visit another time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I only meant inconvenient to the birthday party,&rsquo; drily said her brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Maurice!&rsquo; cried she, &lsquo;you don&rsquo;t know the boy!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have no doubt that he has a cold.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I know there is a great deal more the matter!&rsquo; cried Albinia. &lsquo;We
      have let him go away to be neglected and badly treated! My poor, dear boy!
      Edmund, I will fetch him home to-morrow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You had better send me,&rsquo; said Maurice, mischievously, for he saw he was
      diminishing Mr. Kendal&rsquo;s alarm, and had a brotherly love of teasing
      Albinia, and seeing how pretty she looked with her eyes flashing through
      wrathful tears, and her foot patting impetuously on the carpet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You!&rsquo; she cried; &lsquo;you don&rsquo;t believe in him! You fancy all boys are made
      of iron and steel&mdash;you would only laugh at him&mdash;you made us send
      him there&mdash;I wish&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gently, gently, my dear Albinia,&rsquo; said her husband, dismayed at her
      vehemence, just when it most amused her brother. &lsquo;You cannot expect
      Maurice to feel exactly as we do, and I confess that I have much hope that
      this alarm may be more than adequate.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He thinks it all a scheme!&rsquo; said Albinia, in a tone of great injury.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, indeed, Albinia,&rsquo; answered her brother, seriously, &lsquo;I fully believe
      that Gilbert imagines all that he tells you, but you cannot suppose that
      either the tutor or doctor could fail to see if he were so very ill.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly not,&rsquo; assented Mr. Kendal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And low spirits are more apt to accompany a slight ailment, than such an
      illness as you apprehend.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I believe you are right,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal. &lsquo;Where is the letter?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia did not like it to come under discussion, but could not withhold
      it, and as she read it again, she felt that neither Maurice nor her cousin
      Fred could have written the like, but she was only the more impelled to do
      battle, and when she came to the unlucky conclusion, she exclaimed, &lsquo;I am
      sure that was an afterthought. I dare say Price asked him while he was
      writing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rsquo; asked Mr. Kendal, coming to the &lsquo;presentiment.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated, afraid both of him and of Maurice, but there was no
      alternative. &lsquo;Poor Gilbert!&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;It was a cry or call from his
      brother just at last. It has left a very deep impression.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed!&rsquo; said his father, much moved. &lsquo;Yes. Edmund gave a cry such as was
      not to be forgotten,&rsquo; and the sigh told how it had haunted his own pillow;
      &lsquo;but I had not thought that Gilbert was in a condition to notice it. Did
      he mention it to you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, not long after I came, he thinks it was a call, and I have never
      known exactly how to deal with it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is a case for very tender handling,&rsquo; said Maurice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should have desired him never to think of it again,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal,
      decidedly. &lsquo;Mere nonsense to dwell on it. Their names were always in
      Edmund&rsquo;s mouth, and it was nothing but accident. You should have told him
      so, Albinia.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And he walked out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! it will prey upon him now,&rsquo; said Albinia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I thought he only spoke of driving it away because it was what he
      would like to be able to do. But things do not prey on people of his age
      as they do on younger ones.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wonder if I did right,&rsquo; said Albinia. &lsquo;I never liked to ask you, though
      I wished it. I could not bear to treat it as a fancy. How was I to know,
      if it may not have been intended to do him good? And you see his father
      says it was very remarkable.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you imagine that it dwells much upon his mind?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not when he is well&mdash;not when it would do him good,&rsquo; said Albinia;
      &lsquo;it rather haunts him the instant he is unwell.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He makes it a superstition, then, poor boy! You thought me hard on him,
      Albinia; but really I could not help being angry with him for so
      lamentably frightening his father and you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let us see how he is before you find fault with him,&rsquo; said Albinia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re as bad as if you were his mother, or worse!&rsquo; exclaimed Maurice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! Maurice, I can&rsquo;t help it! He had no one to care for him till I came,
      and he is such a very dear fellow&mdash;he wants me so much!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ferrars agreed to go with Mr. Kendal to Traversham. He thought his
      father would be encouraged by his presence, and he was not devoid of
      curiosity. Albinia would not hear of staying at home; in fact, Maurice
      suspected her of being afraid to trust Gilbert to his mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a trembling heart she left the train at the little Traversham
      station, making resolutions neither to be too angry with the negligent
      tutor, nor to show Gilbert how much importance she attached to his
      illness.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they walked into the village, they heard a merry clamour of tongue, and
      presently met five or six boys, and, a few paces behind them, Mr. Downton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; he exclaimed, &lsquo;I am glad you are come. I would have written
      yesterday, but that I found your boy had done so. I shall be very glad to
      have him cheered up about himself. I will turn back with you. You go on,
      Price. They are setting out for one of Hullah&rsquo;s classes, so we shall have
      the house clear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope there is not much amiss?&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A tedious cold,&rsquo; said the tutor; &lsquo;but the doctor assures me that there is
      nothing wrong with his chest, and I do believe he would not cough half so
      much, if he were not always watching himself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who has been attending him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lee, the union doctor, a very good man, with a large family,&rsquo; (Albinia
      could have beaten him). &lsquo;Indeed,&rsquo; he continued perceiving some
      dissatisfied looks, &lsquo;I think you will find that a little change is all
      that he wants.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope you can give a good account of him in other respects?&rsquo; said Mr.
      Kendal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! yes, in every way; he is the most good-natured lad in the world, and
      quite the small boys&rsquo; friend. Perhaps he has been a little more
      sentimental of late, but that may be only from being rather out of order.
      I&rsquo;ll call him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The last words were spoken as they entered the parsonage, where opening a
      door, he said, &lsquo;Here, Kendal, here&rsquo;s a new prescription for you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia had a momentary view of a tabby-cat and kitten, a volume of
      poetry, a wiry-haired terrier, and Gilbert, all lying promiscuously on the
      hearth-rug, before the two last leaped up, the one to bark, and the other
      to come forward with outstretched hand, and glad countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked flushed and languid, but the roaring fire and close room might
      account for that, and though, when the subject was mentioned, he gave a
      short uncomfortable cough, Albinia&rsquo;s mind was so far relieved, that she
      was in doubt with whom to be angry, and prepared to stand on the
      defensive, should her brother think him too well.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentlemen went away together, and Gilbert, grasping her hand, gave way
      to one of his effusions of affection&mdash;&lsquo;So kind to come to him&mdash;he
      knew he had her to trust to, whatever happened&rsquo;&mdash;and he leant his
      cheek on his hand in a melancholy mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be so piteous, Gibbie,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;You were quite right to tell us
      you were not well, only you need not have been so very doleful, I don&rsquo;t
      like papa to be frightened.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thought it was no use to go on in this way,&rsquo; said Gilbert, with a
      cough: &lsquo;it was the old thing over again, and nobody would believe I had
      anything the matter with me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And he commenced a formidable catalogue of symptoms which satisfied her
      that Maurice would think him fully justified. Just at a point where it was
      not easy to know what next to say, the kitten began to play tricks with
      her mother&rsquo;s tail, and a happy diversion was made; Gilbert began to
      exhibit the various drolleries of the animals, to explain the friendship
      between dog and cat, and to leave off coughing as he related anecdotes of
      their sagacity; and finally, when the gentlemen returned, laughing was the
      first sound they heard, and Mrs. Kendal was found sitting on the floor at
      play with the livestock.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had come to fetch her to see the church and schools, and on going
      out, she found that Mr. Ferrars had moved and carried that Gilbert should
      be taken home at once, and, on the way, be shown to a physician at the
      county town. From this she gathered that Maurice was compassionate, and
      though, of course, he would make no such admission, she had reason
      afterwards to believe that he had shown Mr. Downton that the pupil&rsquo;s
      health ought to have met with a shade more attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Gilbert wrapped up to the tip of his nose, they set off, and found
      the doctor at home. Nothing could have been more satisfactory to Albinia,
      for it gave her a triumph over her brother, without too much anxiety for
      the future. The physician detected the injury to the lungs left by an
      attack that the boy had suffered from in his first English winter, and had
      scarcely outgrown when Albinia first knew him. The recent cold had so far
      renewed the evil, that though no disease actually existed, the cough must
      be watched, and exposure avoided; in fact, a licence for petting to any
      extent was bestowed, and therewith every hope of recovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia and her son sat in their corners of the carriage in secret
      satisfaction, while Mr. Kendal related the doctor&rsquo;s opinion to Mr.
      Ferrars, but one of them, at least, was unprepared for the summing-up.
      &lsquo;Under the circumstances, Gilbert is most fortunate. A few years in his
      native climate will quite set him up.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! but he is too old for Haileybury,&rsquo; burst out Albinia, in her
      consternation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nearly old enough for John Kendal&rsquo;s bank, eh, Gilbert?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; cried Albinia, &lsquo;pray don&rsquo;t let us talk of that while poor Gilbert is
      so ill.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hm!&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal with interrogative surprise, almost displeasure, and
      no more was said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia felt guilty, as she remembered that she had no more intended to
      betray her dislike to the scheme, than to gratify Gilbert by calling him
      &lsquo;so ill.&rsquo; Aristocratic and military, she had no love for the monied
      interest, and had so sedulously impressed on her friends that Mr. Kendal
      had been in the Civil Service, and quite unconnected with the bank, that
      Mr. Ferrars had told her she thought his respectability depended on it,
      and she was ashamed that her brother should hear her give way again so
      foolishly to the weakness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert became the most talkative as they drew near home, and was the
      first to spring out and open the hall door, displaying his two sisters
      harnessed tandem-fashion with packthread, and driven at full speed by
      little Maurice, armed with the veritable carriage whip! The next moment it
      was thrown down, with a rapturous shout, and Maurice was lost to
      everything but his brother!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! girls, how could you let him serve you so?&rsquo; began the horrified
      Albinia. &lsquo;Sophy will be laid up for a week!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never mind,&rsquo; said Sophy, dropping on a chair. &lsquo;Poor little fellow, he
      wished it so much!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I tried to stop her, mamma,&rsquo; said Lucy, &lsquo;but she will do as Maurice
      pleases.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;See, this is the way they will spoil my boy, the instant my back is
      turned!&rsquo; said Albinia. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the use of all I can do with him, if every
      one else will go and be his bond-slave! I do believe Sophy would let him
      kill her, if he asked her!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is no real kindness,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal. &lsquo;Their good-nature ought not to
      go beyond reason.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The elder Maurice could hardly help shrugging his shoulders. Well did he
      know that Mr. Kendal would have joined the team if such had been the will
      of that sovereign in scarlet merino, who stood with one hand in Gilbert&rsquo;s,
      and the whip in the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come here, Maurice,&rsquo; quoth Albinia; &lsquo;put down the whip,&rsquo; and she
      extracted it from his grasp, with grave resolution, against which he made
      no struggle, gave it to Lucy to be put away, and seated him on her knee.
      &lsquo;Now listen, Maurice; poor sister Sophy is tired, and you are never to
      make a horse of her. Do you hear?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Maurice, fidgeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mind, if ever you make a horse of Sophy, mamma will put you into the
      black cupboard. You understand?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sophy shan&rsquo;t be horse,&rsquo; said Maurice. &lsquo;Sophy naughty, lazy horse. Boy has
      Gibbie&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s gratitude,&rsquo; said Mr. Ferrars, as &lsquo;Boy&rsquo; slid off his mamma&rsquo;s knee,
      stood on tiptoe to pull the door open, and ran after Gilbert to
      grandmamma&rsquo;s room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Albinia, &lsquo;no one is grateful for services beyond all reason.
      So, Sophy, mind, into the cupboard he goes, the very next time you are so
      silly as to be a horse.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To punish which of them?&rsquo; asked her brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sophy knows,&rsquo; said Albinia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy was too miserable to smile. Sarah Anne Drury had been calling, and
      on hearing of Gilbert&rsquo;s indisposition, had favoured them with &lsquo;mamma&rsquo;s
      remarks,&rsquo; and when Mrs. Kendal was blamed, Sophy had indignantly told
      Sarah Anne that she knew nothing about it, and had no business to
      interfere. Then followed the accusation, that Mrs. Kendal had set the
      whole family against their old friends, and Sophy had found all her own
      besetting sins charged upon her step-mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear!&rsquo; said Albinia, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t you know that if a royal tiger were to eat
      up your cousin John in India, the Drurys would say Mrs. Kendal always let
      the tigers run about loose! Nor am I sure that your faults are not my
      fault. I helped you to be more exclusive and intolerant, and I am sure I
      tried your temper, when I did not know what was the matter with you&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No&mdash;no,&rsquo; said the choked voice. It would have been an immense
      comfort to cry, or even to be able to return the kiss; but she was a great
      deal too wretched to be capable of any demonstration; physically exhausted
      by being driven about by Maurice; mentally worn out by the attempts to be
      amiable, which had degenerated into wrangling, full of remorse for having
      made light of her brother&rsquo;s illness, and, for that reason, persuaded that
      she was to be punished by seeing it become fatal. Not a word of all this
      did she say, but, dejected and silent, she spent the evening in a lonely
      corner of the drawing-room, while her brother, in the full pleasure of
      returning home, and greatly enjoying his invalid privileges, was
      discussing the projected improvements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Talking at last brought back his cough with real violence, and he was sent
      to bed; Albinia went up with him to see that his fire burnt. He set Mr.
      Ferrars&rsquo;s drawing of the alms-houses over his mantelshelf. &lsquo;I shall nail
      it up to-morrow,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;I always wanted a picture here, and that&rsquo;s a
      jolly one to look to.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It would be a beautiful beginning,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;I think your life would go
      the better for it, Gibbie.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose old nurse would be too grand for one,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;but I should
      like to have her so near! And you must mind and keep old Mrs. Baker out of
      the Union for it. And that famous old blind sailor! I shall put him up a
      bench to sit in the sun, and spin his yarns on, and tell him to think
      himself at Greenwich.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia went down, only afraid that his being so very good was a dangerous
      symptom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy was far from well in the morning, and Albinia kept her upstairs, and
      sent her godfather to make her a visit. He always did her good; he knew
      how to probe deeply, and help her to speak, and he gave her advice with
      more experience than his sister, and more encouragement than her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy said little, but her eyes had a softened look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One good thing about Sophy,&rsquo; said he afterwards to his sister, &lsquo;is, that
      she will never talk her feelings to death.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That reserve is my great pain. I don&rsquo;t get at the real being once in six
      months.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So much the better for people living together.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I was thinking that you and I are a great deal more intimate and
      confidential when we meet now, than we used to be when we were always
      together.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;People can&rsquo;t be often confidential from the innermost when they live
      together,&rsquo; said Maurice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Since I have been a Kendal, such has been my experience.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was the same before, only we concealed it by an upper surface of
      chatter,&rsquo; said Maurice. &lsquo;&ldquo;As iron sharpeneth iron, so doth a man the
      countenance of his friend;&rdquo; but if the mutual sharpening went on without
      intermission, both irons would wear away, and no work would be done.
      Aren&rsquo;t you coming with me? Edmund is going to drive me to Woodside to meet
      the pony-carriage from home.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish I could; but you see what happens when I go out pleasuring!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, you can take one element of mischief with you&mdash;that imp,
      Maurice.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ye&mdash;es. Papa would like it, if you do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should like you to come on worse terms.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well, then; and Sophy is safe; I had already asked Genevieve to come
      and read to her this afternoon. If Gilbert can spare me, I will go.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert did not want her, and begged Lucy not to think of staying indoors
      on his account. He was presently left in solitary possession of the
      drawing-room, whereupon he rose, settled his brown locks at the glass,
      arranged his tie, brushed his cuffs, leisurely walked upstairs, and tapped
      at the door of the morning-room, meekly asking, &lsquo;May I come in?&rsquo; with a
      cough at each end of the sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! Gilbert!&rsquo; cried his anxious sister, starting up. &lsquo;Are you come to see
      me?&rsquo; and she would have wheeled round her father&rsquo;s arm-chair for him, but
      Genevieve was beforehand with her, and he sank into it, saying
      pathetically, &lsquo;Ah! thank you, Miss Durant; you are come to a perfect
      hospital. Oh! this is too much,&rsquo; as she further gave him a footstool. &lsquo;Oh!
      no, thank you, Sophy,&rsquo; for she would have handed Genevieve her own pillow
      for his further support; &lsquo;this is delightful!&rsquo; reclining pathetically in
      his chair. &lsquo;This is not like Traversham.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where they would not believe he was ill!&rsquo; said Sophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope he does not look so very ill,&rsquo; said Genevieve, cheerfully, but
      this rather hurt the feelings of both; the one said, &lsquo;Oh! but he is
      terribly pale,&rsquo; the other coughed, and said, &lsquo;Looks are deceitful.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is the very reason,&rsquo; said Genevieve. &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t look deceitful
      enough to be so ill&mdash;so ill as Miss Sophie fears; now you are at
      home, and well cared for, you will soon be well.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Care would have prevented it all,&rsquo; said Sophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And not brought me home!&rsquo; said Gilbert. &lsquo;Home is home on any terms. No
      one there had the least idea a fellow could ever be unwell or out of
      spirits!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! you must have been ill,&rsquo; cried his sister, &lsquo;you who never used to be
      miserable!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert gave a sigh. &lsquo;They were such mere boys,&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Monsieur votre Precepteur?&rsquo; asked Genevieve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! he was otherwise occupied!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is some mystery beneath,&rsquo; said Genevieve, turning to Sophy, who
      exclaimed abruptly, &lsquo;Oh! is he in love?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sophy goes to the point,&rsquo; said Gilbert, smiling, the picture of languid
      comfort; &lsquo;but I own there are suspicious circumstances. He always has a
      photograph in his pocket, and Price has seen him looking at it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! depend upon it, Miss Sophy, it is all a romance of these young
      gentlemen,&rsquo; said Genevieve, turning to her with a droll provoking air of
      confidence; &lsquo;ce pauvre Monsieur had the portrait of his sister!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Catch me carrying Sophy&rsquo;s face in my waistcoat pocket, cried Gilbert,
      forgetting his languor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Speak for yourself, Mr. Gilbert,&rsquo; laughed Genevieve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And he writes letters every day, and wont let any of us put them into the
      post for him; but we know the direction begins with Miss&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! the curious boys!&rsquo; cried Genevieve. &lsquo;If I could only hint to this
      poor tutor to let them read Miss Downton on one!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I assure you,&rsquo; cried Gilbert, &lsquo;Price has laid a bet that she&rsquo;s an heiress
      with forty thousand pounds and red hair.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Price is an impertinent! I hope you will inform me how he looks when
      he is the loser.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But he has seen her! He met Mr. Downton last Christmas in Regent Street,
      in a swell carriage, with a lady with such carrots, he thought her bonnet
      was on fire; and Mr. Downton never saw Price, though he bowed to him, and
      you know nobody would marry a woman with red hair unless she was an
      heiress.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Miss Sophy,&rsquo; whispered Genevieve, &lsquo;prepare for a red-haired
      sister-in-law. I predict that every one of the pupils of the respectable
      Mr. Downton will marry ladies with lively chestnut locks.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What, you think me so mercenary, Genevieve?&rsquo; said Gilbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I only hope to see this school-boy logic well revenged!&rsquo; said Genevieve.
      &lsquo;Mrs. Price shall have locks of orange red, and for Mrs. Gilbert Kendal&mdash;ah!
      we will content ourselves with her having a paler shade&mdash;sandy gold.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Gilbert, speaking slowly, turning round his eyes. &lsquo;I could tell
      you what Mrs. G. Kendal&rsquo;s hair will be&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Genevieve let this drop, and said, &lsquo;You do not want me: good-bye, Miss
      Sophie.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Going! why, you came to read to me, Genevieve,&rsquo; exclaimed Sophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! I beg your pardon, I have been interrupting you all this time,&rsquo; cried
      Gilbert; &lsquo;I never meant to disturb you. Pray let me listen.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And Genevieve read while Gilbert resumed his reclining attitude, with
      half-closed eyes, listening to the sweet intonations and pretty refined
      accent of the ancien regime.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy enjoyed this exceedingly, she made it her especial occupation to
      take care of Gilbert, and enter into his fireside amusements. This
      indisposition had drawn the two nearer together, and essentially unlike as
      they were, their two characters seemed to be fitting well one into the
      other. His sentiment accorded with her strain of romance, and they read
      poetry and had discussions as they sat over the fire, growing constantly
      into greater intimacy and confidence. Sophy waited on him, and watched him
      perpetually, and her assiduity was imparting a softness and warmth quite
      new to her, while the constant occupation kept affronts and vexations out
      of her sight, and made her amiable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert&rsquo;s health improved, though with vicissitudes that enforced the
      necessity of prudence. Rash when well, and desponding at each renewal of
      illness, he was not easy to manage, but he was always so gentle, grateful,
      and obliging, that he endeared himself to the whole household. It was no
      novelty for him to be devoted to his step-mother and his little brother,
      but he was likewise very kind to Lucy, and spent much time in helping in
      her pursuits; he was becoming companionable to his father, and could play
      at chess sufficiently well to be a worthy antagonist in Mr. Kendal&rsquo;s
      scientific and interminable games. He would likewise play at backgammon
      with grandmamma, and could entertain her for hours together by listening
      to her long stories of the old Bayford world. He was a favourite in her
      little society, and would often take a hand at cards to make up a rubber,
      nay, even when not absolutely required, he was very apt to bestow his
      countenance upon the little parties, where he had the pleasure of being
      treated as a great man, and which, at least, had the advantage of making a
      variation in his imprisonment during the east winds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Belmarche and her daughter and grandchild were sometimes of the
      party, and on these occasions, Sophy always claimed Genevieve, and usually
      succeeded in carrying her off when Gilbert would often join them. Their
      books and prints were a great treat to her; Gilbert had a beautiful
      illustrated copy of Longfellow&rsquo;s poems, and the engravings and
      &lsquo;Evangeline&rsquo; were their enjoyment; Gilbert regularly proffering the loan
      of the book, and she as regularly refusing it, and turning a deaf ear to
      gentle insinuations of the pleasure of knowing that an book of his was in
      her hands. Gilbert had never had much of the schoolboy manner, and he was
      adopting a gentle, pathetic tone, at which Albinia was apt to laugh, but
      in her absence was often verged upon tendresse, especially with Genevieve.
      She, however, by her perfect simplicity and lively banter, always nipped
      the bud of his sentiment, she had known him from a child, and never lost
      the sense of being his elder, treating him somewhat as a boy to be played
      with. Perfectly aware of her own position, her demeanour, frank and
      gracious as it was, had something in it which kept in check other Bayford
      youths less gentlemanlike than Gilbert Kendal. If she never forgot that
      she was dancing-master&rsquo;s daughter, she never let any one else forget that
      she was a lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the building began, Gilbert had a wholesome occupation, saving his
      father some trouble and&mdash;not quite so much expense by overlooking the
      workmen. Mr. Kendal was glad to be spared giving orders and speaking to
      people, and would always rather be overcharged than be at the pains of
      bargaining or inquiring. &lsquo;It was Gilbert&rsquo;s own house,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;and it
      was good for the boy to take an interest in it, and not to be too much
      interfered with.&rsquo; So the bay window and the conservatory were some degrees
      grander than Mr. Ferrars had proposed but all was excused by the pleasure
      and experience they afforded Gilbert, and it was very droll to see Maurice
      following him about after the workmen, watching them most knowingly, and
      deep in mischief at every opportunity. Once he had been up to his knees in
      a tempting blancmanger-like lake of lime, many times had he hammered or
      cut his fingers, and once his legs had gone through the new drawing-room
      ceiling, where he hung by the petticoats screaming till rescued by his
      brother. The room was under these auspices finished, and was a very
      successful affair&mdash;the conservatory, in which the hall terminated,
      and into which a side door of the drawing-room opened, gave a bright
      fragrant, flowery air to the whole house; and the low fireplace and
      comfortable fan-shaped fender made the room very cheerful. Fresh
      delicately-tinted furniture, chosen con amore by the London aunts, had
      made the apartment very unlike old Willow-Lawn, and Albinia had so much
      enjoyed setting it off to the best advantage, that she sent word to
      Winifred that she was really becoming a furniture fancier.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a very pretty paper, and some choice prints hung on it, but Albinia
      and Sophy had laid violent hands on all the best-looking books, and kept
      them for the equipment of one of the walls. The rest were disposed, for
      Mr. Kendal&rsquo;s delectation, in the old drawing-room, henceforth to be named
      the library. Lucy thought it sounded better, and he was quite as willing
      as Albinia was that the name of study should be extinct. Meantime Mr.
      Downton had verified the boys&rsquo; prediction by writing to announce that he
      was about to marry and give up pupils.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert was past seventeen, and it was time to decide on his profession.
      Albinia had virtuously abstained from any hint adverse to the house of
      Kendal and Kendal, for she knew it hurt her husband&rsquo;s feelings to hear any
      disparagement of the country where he had spent some of his happiest
      years. He was fond of his cousins, and knew that they would give his son a
      safe and happy home, and he believed that the climate was exactly what his
      health needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy fired at the idea. Her constant study of the subject and her vivid
      imagination had taken the place of memory, which could supply nothing but
      the glow of colouring and the dazzling haze which enveloped all the forms
      that she would fain believe that she remembered. She and her father would
      discuss Indian scenery as if they had been only absent from it a year, she
      envied Gilbert his return thither, but owned that it was the next thing to
      going herself, and was already beginning to amass a hoard of English gifts
      for the old ayahs and bearers who still lived in her recollection, in
      preparation for the visit which on his first holiday her brother must pay
      to her birthplace and first home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert, however, took no part in this enthusiasm, he made no opposition,
      but showed no alacrity; and at last his father asked Albinia whether she
      knew of any objection on his part, or any design which he might be
      unwilling to put forward. With a beating heart she avowed her cherished
      scheme.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is this his own proposal?&rsquo; asked Mr. Kendal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No; he has never spoken of it, but your plan has always seemed so decided
      that perhaps he thinks he has no choice.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is not what I wish,&rsquo; said his father. &lsquo;If his inclinations be
      otherwise, he has only to speak, and I will consider.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shall I sound him?&rsquo; suggested Albinia, dreading the timidity that always
      stood between the boy and his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do not inspire him with the wish and then imagine it his own,&rsquo; said Mr.
      Kendal; and then thinking he had spoken sternly, added &lsquo;I know you would
      be the last to wish him to take holy orders inconsiderately, but you have
      such power over him, that I question whether he would know his wishes from
      yours.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia began to disavow the desire of actuating him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You would not intend it, but he would catch the desire from you, and I
      own I would rather he were not inspired with it. If he now should express
      it, I should fear it was the unconscious effort to escape from India. If
      it had been his brother Edmund, I would have made any sacrifice, but I do
      not think Gilbert has the energy or force of character I should wish to
      see in a clergyman, nor do I feel willing to risk him at the university.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! Edmund, why will you distrust Oxford? Why will you not believe what I
      know through Maurice and his friends?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If my poor boy had either the disposition or the discipline of your
      brother, I should not feel the same doubt.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Maurice had no discipline except at school and when William licked him,&rsquo; 
      cried Albinia. &lsquo;You know he was but eleven years old when my father died,
      and my aunts spoilt us without mitigation.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I said the disposition,&rsquo; repeated Mr. Kendal; &lsquo;I can see nothing in
      Gilbert marking him for a clergyman, and I think him susceptible to the
      temptations that you cannot deny to exist at any college. Nor would I
      desire to see him fixed here, until he has seen something of life and of
      business, for which this bank affords the greatest facilities with the
      least amount of temptation. He would also be doing something for his own
      support; and with the life-interests upon his property, he must be
      dependent on his own exertions, unless I were to do more for him than
      would be right by the other children.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then I am to say nothing to him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will speak to him myself. He is quite old enough to understand his
      prospects and decide for himself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But, Edmund,&rsquo; cried Albinia, with sudden vehemence, &lsquo;you are not
      sacrificing Gilbert for Maurice&rsquo;s sake?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She had more nearly displeased him than she had ever done before, though
      he looked up quietly, saying, &lsquo;Certainly not. I am not sacrificing
      Gilbert, and I should do the same if Maurice were not in existence.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She was too much ashamed of her foolish fancy to say more, and she cooled
      into candour sufficient to perceive that he was wise in distrusting her
      tact where her preference was so strong. But she foresaw that Gilbert
      would shrink and falter before his father, and that the conference would
      lead to no discovery of his views, and she was not surprised when her
      husband told her that he could not understand the boy, and believed that
      the truth was, that he would like to do nothing at all. It had ended by
      Mr. Kendal, in a sort of despair, undertaking to write to his cousin John
      for a statement of what would be required, after which the decision was to
      be made.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime Mr. Kendal advised Gilbert to attend to arithmetic and
      book-keeping, and offered to instruct him in his long-forgotten
      Hindostanee. Sophy learnt all these with all her heart, but Gilbert always
      had a pain in his chest if he sat still at any kind of study!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Colonel Bury was the most open-hearted old bachelor in the country. His
      imagination never could conceive the possibility of everybody not being
      glad to meet everybody, his house could never be too full, his
      dinner-parties of &lsquo;a few friends&rsquo; overflowed the dining-room, and his
      &lsquo;nobody&rsquo; meant always at least six bodies. Every season was fertile in
      occasions of gathering old and young together to be made happy, and little
      Mary Ferrars, at five years old, had told her mamma that &lsquo;the Colonel&rsquo;s
      parties made her quite dissipated.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      One bright summer day, his beaming face appeared at Willow-Lawn with a
      peremptory invitation. His nephew and heir had newly married a friend of
      Albinia&rsquo;s girlhood, and was about to pay his wedding visit. Too happy to
      keep his guests to himself, the Colonel had fixed the next Thursday for a
      fete, and wanted all the world to come to it&mdash;the Kendals, every one
      of them&mdash;if they could only sleep there&mdash;but Albinia brought him
      to confession that he had promised to lodge five people more than the
      house would hold; and the aunts were at the parsonage, where nobody
      ventured to crowd their servants.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was a moon&mdash;and though Mr. Kendal would not allow that she
      was the harvest moon, the hospitable Colonel dilated on her as if she had
      been bed, board, and lodging, and he did not find much difficulty in his
      persuasions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Few invitations ever gave more delight; Albinia appreciated a holiday to
      the utmost, and the whole family was happy at Sophy&rsquo;s chance of at length
      seeing Fairmead, and taking part in a little gaiety. And if Mr. Kendal&rsquo;s
      expectations of pleasure were less high, he submitted very well, smiled
      benignantly at the felicity around him, and was not once seen to shudder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sarah Anne Drury had been invited to enliven grandmamma, and every one
      augured a beautiful day and perfect enjoyment. The morning was beautiful,
      but alas! Sophy was hors de combat, far too unwell to think of making one
      of the party. She bore the disappointment magnanimously, and even the
      pity. Every one was sorry, and Gilbert wanted her to go and wait at
      Fairmead Parsonage for the chance of improving, promising to come and
      fetch her for any part of the entertainment; and her father told her that
      he had looked to her as his chief companion while the gay people were
      taking their pleasure. No one was uncomfortably generous enough to offer
      to stay at home with her; but Lucy suggested asking Genevieve to come and
      take care of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nay,&rsquo; said Sophy, &lsquo;it would be much better if she were to go in my
      stead.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert and Lucy both uttered an exclamation; and Sophy added, &lsquo;She would
      have so much more enjoyment than I could! Oh, it would quite make up for
      my missing it!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear,&rsquo; said grandmamma, &lsquo;you don&rsquo;t know what you are talking of. It
      would be taking such a liberty.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There need be no scruples on that score,&rsquo; said Albinia; &lsquo;the Colonel
      would only thank me if I brought him half Bayford.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then,&rsquo; cried Sophy, &lsquo;you think we may ask her? Oh, I should like to run
      up myself;&rsquo;&mdash;and a look of congratulation and gratitude passed
      between her and her brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, indeed, you must not, let me go,&rsquo; said Lucy, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll just finish this
      cup of tea&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear, my dear,&rsquo; interposed Mrs. Meadows, &lsquo;pray consider. She is a very
      good little girl in her way, but it is only giving her a taste for things
      out of her station.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! don&rsquo;t say that, dear grandmamma,&rsquo; interposed Albinia, &lsquo;one good
      festival does carry one so much better through days of toil!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, well! my dear, you will do as you think proper; but considering who
      the poor child is, I should call it no kindness to bring her forward in
      company.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Something passed between the indignant Gilbert and Sophy about French
      counts and marquises, but Lucy managed much better. &lsquo;Dear me, grandmamma,
      nobody wishes to bring her forward. She will only play with the children,
      and see the fireworks, and no one will speak to her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia averted further discussion till grandmamma had left the
      breakfast-table, when all four appealed with one voice to Mr. Kendal, who
      saw no objection, whereupon Lucy ran off, while Albinia finished her
      arrangements for the well-being of grandmamma, Sophy, and Maurice, who
      were as difficult to manage as the fox, goose, and cabbage. At every turn
      she encountered Gilbert, touching up his toilette at each glass, and
      seriously consulting her and Sophy upon the choice between lilac and
      lemon-coloured gloves, and upon the bows of his fringed neck-tie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear Gilbert,&rsquo; said Albinia, on the fifth anxious alternative, &lsquo;it is
      of no use. No living creature will be the wiser, and do what you will, you
      will never look half so well as your father.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert flung aside, muttering something about &lsquo;fit to be seen,&rsquo; but just
      then Lucy hurried in. &lsquo;Oh! mamma, she wont go&mdash;she is very much
      obliged, but she can&rsquo;t go.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t! she must,&rsquo; cried Albinia and Gilbert together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She says you are very kind, but that she cannot. I said everything I
      could; I told her she should wear Sophy&rsquo;s muslin mantle, or my second best
      polka.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No doubt you went and made a great favour of it,&rsquo; said Gilbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I assure you I did not; I persuaded her with all my might; I said
      mamma wished it, and we all wished it; and I am sure she would really have
      been very glad if she could have gone.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It can&rsquo;t be the school, it is holiday time,&rsquo; said Gilbert. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go and
      see what is the matter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I will go,&rsquo; said Albinia, &lsquo;I will ask the old ladies to luncheon
      here, and that will make her happy, and make it easier for Sophy to get on
      with Sarah Anne Drury.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy had seen Genevieve alone; Albinia took her by storm before Madame
      Belmarche, whose little black eyes sparkled as she assured Mrs. Kendal
      that the child merited that and every other pleasure; and when Genevieve
      attempted to whisper objections, silenced her with an embrace, saying,
      &lsquo;Ah! my love, where is your gratitude to Madame? Have no fears for us.
      Your pleasure will be ours for months to come.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The liquid sweetness of Genevieve&rsquo;s eyes spoke of no want of gratitude,
      and with glee which she no longer strove to repress, she tripped away to
      equip herself, and Albinia heard her clear young voice upstairs, singing
      away the burthen of some queer old French ditty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia found Gilbert and Sophy in disgrace with Lucy for having gathered
      the choicest flowers, which they were eagerly making up into bouquets.
      Genevieve&rsquo;s was ready before she arrived in the prettiest tremor of
      gratitude and anticipation, and presented to her by Gilbert, whilst Sophy
      looked on, and blushed crimson, face, neck, and all, as Genevieve smelt
      and admired the white roses that had so cruelly been reft from Lucy&rsquo;s
      beloved tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      With every advantage of pretty features, good complexion, and nice figure,
      the English Lucy, in her blue-and-white checked silk, worked muslin
      mantle, and white chip bonnet with blue ribbons, was eclipsed by the small
      swarthy French girl, in that very old black silk dress, and white trimmed
      coarse straw bonnet, just enlivened by little pink bows at the neck and
      wrists. It had long been acknowledged that Genevieve was unrivalled in the
      art of tying bows, and those pink ones were paragons, redolent of all her
      own fresh sprightly archness and refinement. Albinia herself was the best
      representative of English good looks, and never had she been more
      brilliant, her rich chestnut hair waving so prettily on the rounded
      contour of her happy face, her fair cheek tinted with such a healthy fresh
      bloom, her grey eyes laughing with merry softness, her whole person so
      alert and elastic with exuberant life and enjoyment, that grandmamma was
      as happy in watching her as if she had been her own daughter, and stroked
      down the broad flounces of her changeable silk, and admired her black
      lace, as if she felt the whole family exalted by Mrs. Kendal&rsquo;s appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a merry journey, through the meadows and corn-fields, laughing in
      the summer sunshine, and in due time they saw the flag upon Fairmead
      steeple, and Albinia nodded to curtseying old friends at the cottage
      doors. The lodge gate swung open wide, and the well-known striped marquee
      was seen among the trees in the distance, as they went up the carriage
      road; but at the little iron gate leading to the shrubbery there was a
      halt; Mr. Ferrars called to the carriage to stop, and opened the door. At
      the same moment Albinia gave a cry of wonder, and exclaimed, &lsquo;Why, Fred?
      is William here?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No; at Montreal, but very well,&rsquo; was the answer, with a hearty shake of
      the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Edmund, it is Fred Ferrars,&rsquo; said Albinia. &lsquo;Why, Maurice, you never told
      us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He took us by surprise yesterday.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes; I landed yesterday morning, went to the Family Office, found
      Belraven was nowhere, and the aunts at Fairmead, and so came on here,&rsquo; 
      explained Fred, as he finished shaking hands with all the party, and
      walked on beside Albinia. He was tall, fresh-coloured, a good deal like
      her, with a long fair moustache, and light, handsome figure; and Lucy,
      though rather disconcerted at Genevieve being taken for one of themselves,
      began eagerly to whisper her conviction that he was Lord Belraven&rsquo;s
      brother, mamma&rsquo;s first cousin, captain in the 25th Lancers, and
      aide-de-camp to General Ferrars.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the first meeting since an awkward parting. The only son of a
      foolish second marriage, and early left an orphan, Frederick Ferrars bad
      grown up under the good aunts&rsquo; charge, somewhat neglected by his
      half-brother, by many years his senior. He was little older than Albinia,
      and a merry, bantering affection had always subsisted between them, till
      he had begun to give it the air of something more than friendship. Albinia
      was, however, of a nature to seek for something of depth and repose, on
      which to rely for support and anchorage. Fred&rsquo;s vivacious disposition had
      never for a moment won her serious attachment; she was &lsquo;very fond of him,&rsquo; 
      but no more; her heart was set on sharing her brother&rsquo;s life as a country
      pastor. She went to Fairmead, Fred was carried off by the General to
      Canada, and she presently heard of his hopeless attachment to a lovely
      Yankee, whom he met on board the steamer. All this was now cast behind the
      seven most eventful years of Albinia&rsquo;s life; and in the dignity of her
      matronhood, she looked more than ever on &lsquo;poor Fred&rsquo; as a boy, and was
      delighted to see him again, and to hear of her brother William.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few steps brought them to the shade of the large cedar-tree, where was
      seated Winifred, and Mrs. Annesley was with her. The greetings had hardly
      been exchanged before the Colonel came upon them in all his glory, with
      his pretty shy bride niece on his arm, looking very like the Alice Percy
      of the old times, when Fred used to tease the two girls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Genevieve was made heartily welcome, and Sophia&rsquo;s absence deplored, and
      then the Colonel carried off the younger ones to the archery, giving his
      arm to the much-flattered Lucy, and followed by Gilbert and Genevieve,
      with Willie and Mary adhering to them closely, and their governess in
      sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ferrars and Mr. Kendal fell into one of their discussions, and paced
      up and down the shady walk, while Albinia sat, in the complete
      contentment, between Alice and Winifred, with Fred Ferrars on the turf at
      their feet, living over again the bygone days, laughing over ancient
      jokes, resuscitating past scrapes, tracing the lot of old companions, or
      telling mischievous anecdotes of each other, for the very purpose of being
      contradicted. They were much too light-hearted to note the lapse of time,
      till Maurice came to take his wife home, thinking she had had fatigue
      enough. Mrs. Annesley went with her, and Albinia, on looking for her
      husband, was told that he had fallen in with some old Indian
      acquaintances; and Charles Bury presently came to find his wife, and
      conduct the party to luncheon. There was no formal meal, but a perpetual
      refection laid out in the dining-room, for relays of guests. Fred took
      care of Albinia and here they met Miss Ferrars, who had been with one of
      her old friends, to whom she was delighted to exhibit her nephew and niece
      in their prime of good looks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I must go,&rsquo; said Albinia; &lsquo;having found the provisions, I must secure
      that Mr. Kendal and the children are not famished.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Fred came with her, and she turned down the long alley leading to the
      archery-ground. He felt old times so far renewed as to resume their habits
      of confidence, and began, &lsquo;I suppose the General has not told you what has
      brought me home?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He has not so much as told me you were coming.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ay, ay, of course you know how he treats those things.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh&mdash;h!&rsquo; said Albinia, perfectly understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But,&rsquo; continued Frederick, eagerly, &lsquo;even he confesses that she is the
      very sweetest&mdash;I mean,&rsquo; as Albinia smiled at this evident
      embellishment, &lsquo;even he has not a word of objection to make except the old
      story about married officers.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And who is <i>she</i>, Fred?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, mamma, there you are!&rsquo; and Lucy joined them as they emerged on the
      bowling-green, where stood the two bright targets, and the groups of
      archers, whose shafts, for the most part, flew far and wide.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where are the rest, my dear? are they shooting?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes; Gilbert has been teaching Genevieve&mdash;there, she is shooting
      now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The little light figure stood in advance. Gilbert held her arrows, and
      another gentleman appeared to be counselling her. There seemed to be
      general exultation when one of her arrows touched the white ring outside
      the target.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That has been her best shot,&rsquo; said Lucy. &lsquo;I am sure I would not shoot in
      public unless I knew how!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you not like shooting?&rsquo; asked Captain Ferrars; and Lucy smiled, and
      lost her discontented air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It hurts my fingers, she said; &lsquo;and I have always so much to do in the
      garden.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia asked if she had had anything to eat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, yes; the Colonel asked Gilbert to carve in the tent there, for the
      children and governesses,&rsquo; said Lucy, &lsquo;he and Genevieve were very busy
      there, but I found I was not of much use so, I came away with the Miss
      Bartons to look at the flowers, but now they are shooting, and I could not
      think what had become of you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And Lucy bestowed her company on Albinia and the Captain, reducing him to
      dashing, disconnected talk, till they met Mr. Kendal, searching for them
      in the same fear that they were starving, and anxious to introduce his
      wife to his Indian friends. When at the end of the path, Albinia looked
      round, the Lancer had disappeared, and Lucy was walking by her father,
      trying to look serenely amused by a discussion on the annexation of the
      Punjaub.
    </p>
    <p>
      The afternoon was spent in pleasant loitering, chiefly with Miss Ferrars,
      who asked much after Sophy, lamented greatly over Winifred&rsquo;s delicate
      health, and was very anxious to know what could have brought Fred home,
      being much afraid it was some fresh foolish attachment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ominous notes were heard from the band, and the Colonel came to tell them
      that there was to be dancing till it was dark enough for the fireworks,
      his little Alice had promised him her first country-dance. Fred Ferrars
      emerged again with a half-laughing, half-imploring, &lsquo;For the sake of old
      times, Albinia! We&rsquo;ve been partners before!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll take care of Lucy,&rsquo; said Albinia, turning to her aunt; but Mr.
      Winthrop had already taken pity on her, and Albinia was led off by her
      cousin to her place in the fast lengthening rank. How she enjoyed it! She
      had cared little for London balls after the first novelty, but these
      Fairmead dances on the turf had always had an Arcadian charm to her fancy,
      and were the more delightful after so long an interval, in the renewal of
      the old scene, and the recognition of so many familiar faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      With bounding step and laughing lips, she flew down the middle, more
      exhilarated every moment, exchanging merry scraps of talk with her partner
      or bright fragments as she poussetted with pair after pair; and when the
      dance was over, with glowing complexion and eyes still dancing, she took
      Fred&rsquo;s arm, and heard the renewal of his broken story&mdash;the praise of
      his Emily, the fairest of Canadians, whom even the General could not
      dislike, though, thorough soldier as he was, he would fain have had all
      military men as devoid of encumbrances as himself, and thought an
      officer&rsquo;s wife one of the most misplaced articles in the world. Poor Fred
      had been in love so often, that he laboured under the great vexation of
      not being able to persuade any of his friends to regard his passion
      seriously, but Albinia was quite sisterly enough to believe him this time,
      and give full sympathy to his hopes and fears. Far less wealth had fallen
      to his lot than to that of his cousins, and his marriage must depend on
      what his brother would &lsquo;do for him,&rsquo; a point on which he tried to be
      sanguine, and Albinia encouraged him against probability, for Lord
      Belraven was never liberal towards his relations, and had lately married
      an expensive wife, with whom he lived chiefly abroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      This topic was not exhausted when Fred fell a prey to the Colonel, who
      insisted on his dancing again, and Albinia telling him to do his duty, he
      turned towards a group that had coalesced round Miss Ferrars, consisting
      of Lucy, Gilbert, Genevieve, and the children from the parsonage, and at
      once bore off the little Frenchwoman, leaving more than one countenance
      blank. Lucy and Willie did their best for mutual consolation, while
      Albinia undertook to preside over her niece and a still smaller partner in
      red velvet, in a quadrille. It was amusing to watch the puzzled downright
      motions of the sturdy little bluff King Hal, and the earnest precision of
      the prim little damsel, and Albinia hovering round, now handing one, now
      pointing to the other, keeping lightly out of every one&rsquo;s way, and far
      more playful than either of the small performers in this solemn
      undertaking. As it concluded she found that Mr. Kendal had been watching
      her, with much entertainment, and she was glad to take his arm, and assure
      herself that he had not been miserable, but had been down to the
      parsonage, where he had read the newspaper in peace, and had enjoyed a cup
      of tea in quiet with Winifred and Mrs. Annesley.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dancing had been transferred to the tent, which presented a very
      pretty scene from without, looking through the drooping festoons of
      evergreens at the lamps and the figures flitting to and fro in their
      measured movements, while the shrubs and dark foliage of the trees fell
      into gloom around; and above, the sky assumed the deep tranquil blue of
      night, the pale bright stars shining out one by one. The Kendals were
      alone in the terrace, far enough from the gay tumult to be sensible of the
      contrast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How beautiful!&rsquo; said Albinia: &lsquo;it is like a poem.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was just thinking so,&rsquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is the best part of all,&rsquo; she said, feeling, though hardly
      expressing to herself the repose of his lofty, silent serenity, standing
      aloof from gaiety and noise. She could have compared him and her lively
      cousin to the evening stillness contrasted with the mirthful scene in the
      tent; and though her nature seemed to belong to the busy world, her best
      enjoyment lay with what calmed and raised her above herself; and she was
      perfectly happy, standing still with her arm upon that of her silent
      husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;These things are well imagined,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;The freedom and absence of
      formality give space for being alone and quiet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Albinia, saucily, &lsquo;when that is what you go into society for.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have me there,&rsquo; he said, smiling; &lsquo;but I must own how much I enjoyed
      coming back from the parsonage by myself. I am glad we brought that little
      Genevieve; she seems to be so perfectly in her element. I saw her amusing
      a set of little children in the prettiest, most animated way; and
      afterwards, when the young people were playing at some game, her gestures
      were so sprightly and graceful, that no one could look at the English
      girls beside her. Indeed I think she was making quite a sensation; your
      cousin seemed to admire her very much. If she were but in another station,
      she would shine anywhere.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How much you have seen, Edmund!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have been a spectator, you an actor,&rsquo; he said, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her quiescence did not long continue, for the poor people had begun to
      assemble on the gravel road before the front door to see the fireworks,
      and she hurried away to renew her acquaintance with her village friends,
      guessing at them in the dark, asking after old mothers and daughters at
      service, inquiring the names of new babies, and whether the old ones were
      at school, and excusing herself for having become &lsquo;quite a stranger.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst&mdash;whish&mdash;hiss, with steady swiftness, up shot in the
      dark purple air the first rocket, bursting and scattering a rain of stars.
      There was an audible gasp in the surrounding homely world, a few little
      cries, and a big boy clutched tight hold of her arm, saying, &lsquo;I be
      afeard.&rsquo; She was explaining away his alarms, when she heard her brother&rsquo;s
      voice, and found her arm drawn into his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here you are, then,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;I thought I heard your voice.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! Maurice, I have hardly seen you. Let us have a nice quiet turn in the
      park together.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He resisted, saying, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t approve of parents and guardians losing
      themselves. What have you done with all your children?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What have you done with yours?&rsquo; retorted she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I left Willie and Mary at the window with their governess, I came to see
      that these other children of mine were orderly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Most proper, prudential, and exemplary Maurice!&rsquo; his sister laughed. &lsquo;Now
      I have an equally hearty belief in my children being somewhere, sure to
      turn up when wanted. Come, I want to get out from the trees to look for
      Colonel Bury&rsquo;s harvest moon, for I believe she is an imposition.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I&rsquo;m not coming. You, don&rsquo;t understand your duties. Your young ladies
      ought always to know where to find you, and you where to find them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! Maurice, what must you have suffered before you imported Winifred to
      chaperon me!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are in so mad a mood that I shall attempt only one moral maxim, and
      that is, that no one should set up for a chaperon, till she has retired
      from business on her own account.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s a stroke at my dancing with poor Fred, but it was his only chance
      of speaking to me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not particularly at the dancing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, then&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll see, by-and-bye. It was not your fault if those girls were not in
      all sorts of predicaments.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I believe you think life is made up of predicaments. And I want to hear
      whether William has written to you anything about poor Fred.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only that he is more mad than ever, and that he let him go, thinking that
      there is no chance of Belraven helping him, but that it may wear itself
      out on the journey.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A revolving circle shedding festoons of purple and crimson jets of fire
      made all their talk interjectional, and they had by this time reached the
      terrace, where all the company were assembled, the open windows at regular
      intervals casting bewildering lights on the heads and shoulders in front
      of them. Then out burst a grand wheat-sheaf of yellow flame with crimson
      ears and beards, by whose light Albinia recognised Gilbert standing close
      to her in the shadow, and asked him where the rest where.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t tell; Lucy and my father were here just now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you feeling the chill, Gilbert?&rsquo; asked Albinia, struck by something
      in his tone. &lsquo;You had better look from the window.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He neither moved nor made answer, but a great illumination of Colonel
      Bury&rsquo;s coat-of-arms, with Roman candles and Chinese trees at the four
      corners, engrossed every eye, and flashing on every face, enabled Albinia
      to join Mr. Kendal, who was with Lucy and Miss Ferrars. No one knew where
      Genevieve was, but Albinia was confident that she could take good care of
      herself, and was not too uneasy to enjoy the grand representation of
      Windsor Castle, and the finale of interlaced ciphers amidst a multitude of
      little fretful sputtering tongues of flame. Then it was, amid good nights,
      donning of shawls, and announcing of carriages, that Captain Ferrars and
      Miss Durant made their appearance together, having been &lsquo;looking
      everywhere for Mrs. Kendal,&rsquo; and it was not in the nature of a brother not
      to look a little arch, though Albinia returned him as resolute and
      satisfied a glance as could express &lsquo;Well, what of that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In consideration of the night air, Mr. Kendal put Gilbert inside the
      carriage, and mounted the box, to revel in the pleasures of silence. The
      four within talked incessantly and compared adventures. Lucy had been
      gratified by being patronized by Miss Ferrars, and likewise had much to
      say of the smaller fry, and went into raptures about many a &lsquo;dear little
      thing,&rsquo; none of whom would, however, stand a comparison with Maurice;
      Gilbert was critical upon every one&rsquo;s beauty; and Genevieve was more
      animated than all, telling anecdotes with great piquancy, and rehearsing
      the comical Yankee stories she had heard from Captain Ferrars. She had
      enjoyed with the zest and intensity of a peculiarly congenial temperament,
      and she seemed not to be able to cease from working off her excitement in
      repetitions of her thanks, and in discussing the endless delights the day
      had afforded.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the day had begun early, and the way was long, so remarks became
      scanty, and answers were brief and went astray, and Albinia thought she
      was travelling for ever to Montreal, when she was startled by a pettish
      exclamation from Lucy, &lsquo;Is that all! It was not worth while to wake me
      only to see the moon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I beg your pardon,&rsquo; said Genevieve, &lsquo;but I thought Mrs. Kendal wished to
      see it rise.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you, Genevieve,&rsquo; said Albinia, opening her sleepy eyes; &lsquo;she is as
      little worth seeing as a moon can well be, a waning moon does well to keep
      untimely hours.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why do you think she is so much more beautiful in the crescent, Mrs.
      Kendal?&rsquo; said Genevieve, in the most wakeful manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; said Albinia, subsiding into her corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it from the situation of the mountains in the moon?&rsquo; continued the
      pertinacious damsel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In Africa!&rsquo; said Albinia, well-nigh asleep, but Genevieve&rsquo;s laugh roused
      her again, partly because she thought it less mannerly than accorded with
      the girl&rsquo;s usual politeness. No mere sleep was allowed her; an
      astronomical passion seemed to have possessed the young lady, and she
      dashed into the tides, and the causes of the harvest-moon, and volcanoes,
      and thunderbolts, and Lord Rosse&rsquo;s telescope, forcing her tired friend to
      reply by direct appeals, till Albinia almost wished her in the moon
      herself; and was rejoiced when in the dim greyness of the early summer
      dawn, the carriage drew up at Madame Belmarche&rsquo;s house. As the light from
      the weary maid&rsquo;s candle flashed on Genevieve&rsquo;s face, it revealed such a
      glow of deep crimson on each brown cheek, that Albinia perceived that the
      excitement must have been almost fever, and went to bed speculating on the
      strange effects of a touch of gaiety on the hereditary French nature,
      startling her at once from her graceful propriety and humility of
      demeanour, into such extraordinary obtrusive talkativeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      She heard more the next morning that vexed her. Lucy was seriously of
      opinion that Genevieve had not been sufficiently retiring. She herself had
      heedfully kept under the wing of Mary&rsquo;s governess, mamma, or Miss Ferrars,
      and nobody had paid her any particular attention; but Genevieve had been
      with Gilbert half the day, had had all the gentlemen round her at the
      archery and in the games, had no end of partners in the dances, and had
      walked about in the dark with Captain Ferrars. Lucy was sure she was taken
      for her sister, and whenever she had told people the truth, they had said
      how pretty she was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are jealous, Lucy,&rsquo; Sophy said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy protested that it was quite the reverse. She was glad poor little
      Jenny should meet with any notice, there was no cause for jealousy of <i>her</i>,
      and she threw back her head in conscious beauty; &lsquo;only she was sorry for
      Jenny, for they were quite turning her head, and laughing at her all the
      time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia&rsquo;s candour burst out as usual, &lsquo;Say no more about it, my dear; it
      was a mistake from beginning to end. I was too much taken up with my own
      diversion to attend to you, and now you are punishing me for it. I left
      you to take care of yourselves, and exposed poor little Genevieve to
      unkind remarks.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I said,&rsquo; began Lucy. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t mean to blame her; it was
      just as she always is with Gilbert, so very French.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      That word settled it&mdash;Lucy pronounced it with ineffable pity and
      contempt&mdash;she was far less able to forgive another for being
      attractive, than for trying to attract.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy looked excessively hurt and grieved, and in private asked her
      step-mother what she thought of Genevieve&rsquo;s behaviour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear, I cannot tell; I think she was off her guard with excitement;
      but all was very new to her, and there was every excuse. I was too happy
      to be wise, so no wonder she was.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And do you think Captain Ferrars was laughing at her? I wish you would
      tell her, mamma. Gilbert says he is a fine, flourishing officer in
      moustaches, who, he is sure, flirts with and breaks the heart of every
      girl he meets. If he is right, mamma, it would cure Genevieve to tell her
      so, and you would not mind it, though he is your cousin.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor Fred!&rsquo; said Albinia. &lsquo;I am sorry Gilbert conceived such a notion.
      But Genevieve&rsquo;s heart is too sensible to break in that way, even if Fred
      wished it, and I can acquit him of such savage intentions. I never should
      have seen any harm in all that Genevieve did last night if she had not
      talked us to death coming home! Still I think she was off her balance, and
      I own I am disappointed. But we don&rsquo;t know what it is to be born French!&rsquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mrs. Kendal, dear Madame, a great favour, could you spare me a few
      moments?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A blushing face was raised with such an expression of contrite timidity,
      that Albinia felt sure that the poor little Frenchwoman had recovered from
      her brief intoxication, and wanted to apologize and be comforted, so she
      said kindly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was wishing to see you, my dear; I was afraid the day had been too much
      for you; I was certain you were feverish.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! you were so good to make excuses for me. I am so ashamed when I think
      how tedious, how disagreeable I must have been. It was why I wished to
      speak to you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never mind apologies, my dear; I have felt and done the like many a time&mdash;it
      is the worst of enjoying oneself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! that was not all&mdash;I could not help it&mdash;enjoyment&mdash;no!&rsquo; 
      stammered Genevieve. &lsquo;If you would be kind enough to come this way.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She opened her grandmother&rsquo;s back gate, the entrance to a slip of garden
      smothered in laurels, and led the way to a small green arbour, containing
      a round table, transformed by calico hangings into what the embroidered
      inscription called &lsquo;Autel a l&rsquo;Amour filial et maternel,&rsquo; bearing a plaster
      vase full of fresh flowers, but ere Albinia had time to admire this
      achievement of French sentiment, Genevieve exclaimed, clasping her hands,
      &lsquo;Oh, madame, pardon me, you who are so good! You will tell no one, you
      will bring on him no trouble, but you will tell him it is too foolish&mdash;you
      will give him back his billet, and forbid him ever to send another.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Spite of the confidence about Emily, spite of all unreason, such was the
      family opinion of Fred&rsquo;s propensity to fall in love, that Albinia&rsquo;s first
      suspicion lighted upon him, but as her eye fell on the pink envelope the
      handwriting concerned her even more nearly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gilbert!&rsquo; she cried. &lsquo;My dear, what is this? Do you wish me to read it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, for I cannot.&rsquo; Genevieve turned away, as in his best hand, and bad
      it was, Albinia read the commencement&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My hope, my joy, my Genevieve!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In mute astonishment Albinia looked up, and met Genevieve&rsquo;s eyes. &lsquo;Oh,
      madame, you are displeased with me!&rsquo; she cried in despair, misinterpreting
      the look, &lsquo;but indeed I could not help it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear child,&rsquo; said Albinia, affectionately putting her arm round her
      waist, and drawing her down on the seat beside her, &lsquo;indeed I am not
      displeased with you; you are doing the very best thing possible by us all.
      Think I am your sister, and tell me what is the meaning of all this, and
      then I will try to help you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, madame, you are too good,&rsquo; said Genevieve, weeping; and kindly
      holding the trembling hand, Albinia finished the letter, herself. &lsquo;Silly
      boy! Genevieve, dear girl, you must set my mind at rest; this is too
      childish&mdash;this is not the kind of thing that would touch your
      affections, I am sure.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! pour cela non,&rsquo; said Genevieve. &lsquo;Oh! no; I am grateful to Mr. Gilbert
      Kendal, for, even as a little boy, he was always kind to me, but for the
      rest&mdash;he is so young, madame, even if I could forget&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I see,&rsquo; said Albinia. &lsquo;I am sure that you are much too good and sensible
      at your age to waste a moment&rsquo;s thought or pain on such a foolish boy, as
      he certainly is, Genevieve, though not so foolish in liking you, whatever
      he may be in the way of expressing it. Though of course&mdash;&rsquo; Albinia
      had floundered into a dreadful bewilderment between her sense of
      Genevieve&rsquo;s merits and of the incompatibility of their station, and she
      plunged out by asking, &lsquo;And how long has this been going on?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Genevieve hesitated. &lsquo;To speak the truth, madame, I have long seen that,
      like many other youths, he would be&mdash;very attentive if one were not
      guarded; but I had known him so long, that perhaps I did not soon enough
      begin, to treat him en jeune homme.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And this is his first letter?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! yes, madame.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He complains that you will not hear him? Do you dislike to tell me if
      anything had passed previously?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thursday,&rsquo; was slightly whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thursday! ah! now I begin to understand the cause of your being suddenly
      moon-struck.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! madame, pardon me!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I see&mdash;it was the only way to avoid a tete-a-tete!&rsquo; said Albinia.
      &lsquo;Well done, Genevieve. What had he been saying to you, my dear?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Genevieve cast about for a word, and finally faltered out, &lsquo;Des
      sottises, Madame.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That I can well believe,&rsquo; said Albinia. &lsquo;Well, my dear&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think,&rsquo; pursued Genevieve, &lsquo;that he was vexed because I would not let
      him absorb me exclusively at Fairmead; and began to reproach me, and
      protest&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And like a wise woman you waked the sleeping dragon,&rsquo; said Albinia. &lsquo;Was
      this all?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, madame; so little had passed, that I hoped it was only the
      excitement, and that he would forget; but on Saturday he met me in the
      flagged path, and oh! he said a great deal, though I did my best to
      convince him that he could only make himself be laughed at. I hoped even
      then that he was silenced, and that I need not mention it, but I see he
      has been watching me, and I dare not go out alone lest I should meet him.
      He called this morning, and not seeing me left this note.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do your grandmother and aunt know?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, no! I would far rather not tell them. Need I? Oh! madame, surely you
      can speak to him, and no one need ever hear of it?&rsquo; implored Genevieve.
      &lsquo;You have promised me that no one shall be told!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No one shall, my dear. I hope soon to tell you that he is heartily
      ashamed of having teased you. No one need be ashamed of thinking you very
      dear and good&mdash;you can&rsquo;t help being loveable, but Master Gibbie has
      no right to tell you so, and we&rsquo;ll put an end to it. He will soon be in
      India out of your way. Good-bye!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia kissed the confused and blushing maiden, and walked away,
      provoked, yet diverted.
    </p>
    <p>
      She found Gilbert alone, and was not slow in coming to the point,
      endeavouring to model her treatment on that of her brother, the General,
      towards his aide-de-camp in the like predicaments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gilbert, I want to speak to you. I am afraid you have been making
      yourself troublesome to Miss Durant. You are old enough to know better
      than to write such a note as this.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He was all one blush, made an inarticulate exclamation, and burst out,
      &lsquo;That abominable treacherous old wooden doll of a mademoiselle.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, Miss Belmarche knows nothing of it. No one ever shall if you will
      promise to drive this nonsense out of your head.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nonsense! Mrs. Kendal!&rsquo; with a gesture of misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gilbert, you are making yourself absurd.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned about, and would have marched out of the room, but she pursued
      him. &lsquo;You must listen to me. It is not fit that you should carry on this
      silly importunity. It is exceedingly distressing to her, and might lead to
      very unpleasant and hurtful remarks.&rsquo; Seeing him look sullen, she took
      breath, and considered. &lsquo;She came to me in great trouble, and begged me to
      restore your letter, and tell you never to repeat the liberty.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He struck his hand on his brow, crying vehemently, &lsquo;Cruel girl! She little
      knows me&mdash;you little know me, if you think I am to be silenced thus.
      I tell you I will never cease! I am not bound by your pride, which has
      sneered down and crushed the loveliest&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not mine,&rsquo; said Albinia, disconcerted at his unexpected violence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes!&rsquo; he exclaimed. &lsquo;I know you could patronize! but a step beyond, and
      it is all the same with you as with the rest&mdash;you despise the jewel
      without the setting.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Albinia, &lsquo;so far from depreciating her, I want to convince you
      that it is an insult to pursue her in this ridiculous underhand way.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You do me no justice,&rsquo; said Gilbert loftily; &lsquo;you little understand what
      you are pleased to make game of,&rsquo; and with one of his sudden alternations,
      he dropped into a chair, calling himself the most miserable fellow in the
      world, unpitied where he would gladly offer his life, and his tenderest
      feelings derided, and he was so nearly ready to cry, that Albinia pitied
      him, and said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll laugh no more if I can help it, Gibbie, but indeed
      you are too young for all this misery to be real. I don&rsquo;t mean that you
      are pretending, but only that this is your own fancy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fancy!&rsquo; said the boy solemnly. &lsquo;The happiness of my life is at stake. She
      shall be the sharer of all that is mine, the moment my property is in my
      own hands.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And do you think so high-minded a girl would listen to you, and take
      advantage of a fancy in a boy so much younger, and of a different class?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It would be ecstasy to raise her, and lay all at her feet!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So it might, if it were worthy of her to accept it. Gilbert, if you knew
      what love is, you would never wish her to lower herself by encouraging you
      now. She would be called artful&mdash;designing&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If she loved me&mdash;&rsquo; he said disconsolately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish I could bring you to see how unlikely it is that a sensible,
      superior woman could really attach herself to a mere lad. An unprincipled
      person might pretend it for the sake of your property&mdash;a silly one
      might like you because you are good-looking and well-mannered; but neither
      would be Genevieve.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is no use in saying any more,&rsquo; he said, rising in offended dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I cannot let you go till you have given me your word never to obtrude
      your folly on Miss Durant again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you anything else to ask me?&rsquo; cried Gilbert in a melodramatic tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, how would you like your father to know of this? It is her secret,
      and I shall keep it, unless you are so selfish as to continue the pursuit,
      and if so, I must have recourse to his authority.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! Mrs. Kendal,&rsquo; he said, actually weeping, &lsquo;you have always pitied me
      hitherto.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A man should not ask for pity,&rsquo; said Albinia; &lsquo;but I am sorry for you,
      for she is an admirable person, and I see you are very unhappy; but I will
      do all I can to help you, and you will get over it, if you are reasonable.
      Now understand me, I will and must protect Genevieve, and I shall appeal
      to your father unless you promise me to desist from this persecution.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The debate might have been endless, if Mr. Kendal had not been heard
      coming in. &lsquo;You promise?&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; was the faint reply, in nervous
      terror of immediate reference to his father; and they hurried different
      ways, trying to look unconcerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never mind,&rsquo; said Albinia to herself. &lsquo;Was not Fred quite as bad about
      me, and look at him now! Yes, Gilbert must go to India, it will cure him,
      or if it should not, his affection will be respectable, and worth
      consideration. If he were but older, and this were the genuine article, I
      would fight for him, but&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And she sat down to write a loving note to Genevieve. Her sanguine
      disposition made her trust that all would blow over, but her experience of
      the cheerful buoyant Ferrars temperament was no guide to the morbid Kendal
      disposition, Gilbert lay on the grass limp and doleful till the fall of
      the dew, when he betook himself to a sofa; and in the morning turned up
      his eyes reproachfully at her instead of eating his breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      About eleven o&rsquo;clock the Fairmead pony-carriage stopped at the door,
      containing Mr. Ferrars, the Captain, Aunt Gertrude, and little Willie.
      Albinia, her husband, and Lucy, were soon in the drawing-room welcoming
      them; and Lucy fetched her little brother, who had been vociferous for
      three days about Cousin Fred, the real soldier, but now, struck with awe
      at the mighty personage, stood by his mamma, profoundly silent, and
      staring. He was ungracious to his aunt, and still more so to Willie, the
      latter of whom was despatched under Lucy&rsquo;s charge to find Gilbert, but
      they came back unsuccessful. Nor did Sophy make her appearance; she was
      reported to be reading to grandmamma&mdash;Mrs. Meadows preferred to Miss
      Ferrars! there was more in this than Albinia could make out, and she sat
      uneasily till she could exchange a few words with Lucy. &lsquo;My dear, what is
      become of the other two?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am sure I don&rsquo;t know what is the matter with them,&rsquo; said Lucy. &lsquo;Gilbert
      is gone out&mdash;nobody knows where&mdash;and when I told Sophy who was
      here, she said Captain Ferrars was an empty-headed coxcomb, and she did
      not want to see him!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! the geese!&rsquo; murmured Albinia to herself, till the comical suspicion
      crossed her mind that Gilbert was jealous, and that Sophy was afraid of
      falling a victim to the redoubtable lady killer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luncheon-time produced Sophy, grave and silent, but no Gilbert, and Mr.
      Kendal, receiving no satisfactory account of his absence, said, &lsquo;Very
      strange,&rsquo; and looked annoyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Ferrars seemed to have expected to see his bright little partner
      of Thursday, for he inquired for her, and Willie imparted the information
      that Fred had taken her for Sophy all the time! Fred laughed, and owned
      it, but asked if she were not really the governess? &lsquo;A governess,&rsquo; said
      Albinia, &lsquo;but not ours,&rsquo; and an explanation followed, during which Sophy
      blushed violently, and held up her head as if she had an iron bar in her
      neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A pity,&rsquo; said the Lancer, when he had heard who she was, and under his
      moustache he murmured to Albinia, &lsquo;She is rather in Emily&rsquo;s style.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, Fred,&rsquo; thought Albinia, &lsquo;after all, it may be lucky that you aren&rsquo;t
      going to stay here!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      When Albinia was alone with her brother, she could not help saying,
      &lsquo;Maurice, you were right to scold me; I reproached you with thinking life
      made up of predicaments. I think mine is made of blunders!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! I saw you were harassed to-day,&rsquo; said her brother kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Whenever one is happy, one does something wrong!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I guess&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are generous not to say you warned me months ago. Mind, it is no
      fault of hers, she is behaving beautifully; but oh! the absurdity, and the
      worst of it is, I have promised not to tell Edmund.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then don&rsquo;t tell me. You have a judgment quite good enough for use.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I have not. I have only sense, and that only serves me for what other
      people ought to do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then ask Albinia what Mrs. Kendal ought to do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert came in soon after their departure, with an odd, dishevelled,
      abstracted look, and muttering something inaudible about not knowing the
      time. His depression absolutely courted notice, but as a slight cough
      would at any time reduce him to despair, he obtained no particular
      observation, except from Sophy, who made much of him, flushed at
      Genevieve&rsquo;s name, and looked reproachful, that it was evident that she was
      his confidante. Several times did Albinia try to lead her to enter on the
      subject, but she set up her screen of silence. It was disappointing, for
      Albinia had believed better things of her sense, and hardly made allowance
      for the different aspect of the love-sorrows of seventeen, viewed from
      fifteen or twenty-six&mdash;vexatious, too, to be treated with dry
      reserve, and probably viewed as a rock in the course of true love; and
      provoking to see perpetual tete-a-tetes that could hardly fail to fill
      Sophy&rsquo;s romantic head with folly.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of another week, Albinia received the following note:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear and most kind Madame,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I would not trouble you again, but this is the third within four days. I
      returned the two former ones to himself, but he continues to write. May I
      ask your permission to speak to my relatives, for I feel that I ought to
      hide this no longer from them, and that we must take some measures for
      ending it. He does me the honour to wait near the house, and I never dare
      go out, since&mdash;for I will confess all to you, madame&mdash;he met me
      by the river on Monday. I am beginning to fear that his assiduities have
      been observed, and I should be much obliged if you would tell me how to
      act. Your kind perseverance in your goodness towards me is my greatest
      comfort, and I hope that you will still continue it, for indeed it is most
      unwillingly that I am a cause of perplexity and vexation to you.
      Entreating your pardon,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                        &lsquo;Your most faithful and obliged servant,
                                             Genevieve Celeste Durant.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      What was to be done? That broken pledge overpowered Albinia with a
      personal sense of shame, and though it set her free to tell all to her
      husband, she shrank from provoking his stern displeasure towards his son,
      and feared he might involve Genevieve in his anger. She dashed off a note
      to her poor little friend, telling her to do as she thought fit by her
      aunt and grandmother, and then sought another interview with the reluctant
      Gilbert, to whom she returned the letter, saying, &lsquo;Oh, Gilbert, at least I
      thought you would keep your word.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think,&rsquo; he said, angrily, trying for dignity, though bewrayed by his
      restless eyes and hands&mdash;&lsquo;I think it is too much to accuse me of&mdash;of&mdash;when
      I never said&mdash;What word did I ever give?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You promised never to persecute her again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There may be two opinions as to what persecution means,&rsquo; said Gilbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I little thought of subterfuges. I trusted you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mrs. Kendal! hear me,&rsquo; he passionately cried. &lsquo;You knew not the misery
      you imposed. To live so near, and not a word, not a look! I bore it as
      long as I could; but when Sophy would not so much as take one message,
      human nature could not endure.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, if you cannot restrain yourself like a rational creature, some
      means must be taken to free Miss Durant from a pursuit so injurious and
      disagreeable to her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ay,&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;you have filled her with your own prejudices, and
      inspired her with such a dread of the hateful fences of society, that she
      does not dare to confess&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For shame, Gilbert, you are accusing her of acting a part.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No!&rsquo; he exclaimed, &lsquo;all I say is, that she has been so thrust down and
      forced back, that she cannot venture to avow her feelings even to
      herself!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; said Albinia, &lsquo;you conceited person!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well!&rsquo; cried the boy, so much nettled by her sarcasm that he did not know
      what he said, &lsquo;I think&mdash;considering&mdash;considering our situations,
      I might be worth her consideration!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who put that in your head?&rsquo; asked Albinia. &lsquo;You are too much a gentleman
      for it to have come there of its own accord.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He blushed excessively, and retracted. &lsquo;No, no! I did not mean that! No, I
      only mean I have no fair play&mdash;she will not even think. Oh! if I had
      but been born in the same station of life!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert making entrechats with a little fiddle! It had nearly overthrown
      her gravity, and she made no direct answer, only saying, &lsquo;Well, Gilbert,
      these talks are useless. I only thought it right to give you notice that
      you have released me from my engagement not to make your father aware of
      your folly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He went into an agony of entreaties, and proffers of promises, but no more
      treaties of secrecy could he obtain, she would only say that she should
      not speak immediately, she should wait and see how things turned out. By
      which she meant, how soon it might be hoped that he would be safe in the
      Calcutta bank, where she heartily wished him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sought a conference with Genevieve, and took her out walking in the
      meadows, for the poor child really needed change and exercise, the fear of
      Gilbert had made her imprison herself within the little garden, till she
      looked sallow and worn. She said that her grandmother and aunt had decided
      that she should go in a couple of days to the Convent at Hadminster, to
      remain there till Mr. Gilbert went to India&mdash;the superior was an old
      friend of her aunt, and Genevieve had often been there, and knew all the
      nuns.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia was startled by this project. &lsquo;My dear, I had much rather send you
      to stay at my brother&rsquo;s, or&mdash;anywhere. Are you sure you are not
      running into temptation?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not of that kind,&rsquo; said Genevieve. &lsquo;The priest, Mr. O&rsquo;Hara, is a
      good-natured old gentleman, not in the least disposed to trouble himself
      about my conversion.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And the sisters?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good old ladies, they have always been very kind to me, and petted me
      exceedingly when I was a little child, but for the rest&mdash;&rsquo; still
      seeing Albinia&rsquo;s anxious look&mdash;&lsquo;Oh! they would not think of it; I
      don&rsquo;t believe they could argue; they are not like the new-fashioned Roman
      Catholics of whom you are thinking, madame.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And are there no enthusiastic young novices?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should think no one would ever be a novice there,&rsquo; said Genevieve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You seem to be bent on destroying all the romance of convents,
      Genevieve!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never thought of anything romantic connected with the reverend
      mothers,&rsquo; rejoined Genevieve, &lsquo;and yet when I recollect how they came to
      Hadminster, I think you will be interested. You know the family at
      Hadminster Hall in the last century were Roman Catholics, and a daughter
      had professed at a convent in France. At the time of the revolution, her
      brother, the esquire, wrote to offer her an asylum at his house. The day
      of her arrival was fixed&mdash;behold! a stage-coach draws up to the door&mdash;black
      veils inside&mdash;black veils clustered on the roof&mdash;a black veil
      beside the coachman, on the box&mdash;eighteen nuns alight, and the poor
      old infirm abbess is lifted out. They had not even figured to themselves
      that the invitation could be to one without the whole sisterhood!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what did the esquire do with the good ladies?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He took them as a gift from Providence, he raised a subscription among
      his friends, and they were lodged in the house at Hadminster, where
      something like a sisterhood had striven to exist ever since the days of
      James II.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are any of these sisters living still?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only poor old Mother Therese, who was a little pensionnaire when they
      came, and now is blind, and never quits her bed. There are only seven
      sisters at present, and none of them are less than five-and-forty.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what shall you do there, Genevieve?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If they have any pupils from the town, perhaps I may help to teach them
      French. And I shall have plenty of time for my music. Oh! madame, would
      you lend me a little of your music to copy?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With all my heart. Any books?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! that would be the greatest kindness of all! And if it were not
      presuming too much, if madame would let me take the pattern of that
      beautiful point lace that she sometimes wears in the evening, then I
      should make myself welcome!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And put out your eyes, my dear! But you may turn out my whole lace-drawer
      if you think anything there will be a pleasure to the old ladies.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! you do not guess the pleasure, madame. Needlework and embroidery is
      their excitement and delight. They will ask me closely about all I have
      seen and done for months past, and the history of the day at Fairmead will
      be a fete in itself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well! my dear, it is very right of you; and I do feel very thankful to
      you for treating the matter thus. Pray tell your grandmamma and aunt to
      pardon the sad revolution we have made in their comfort, and that I hope
      it will soon be over!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Genevieve took no leave. Albinia sent her a goodly parcel of books and
      work-patterns, and she returned an affectionate note; but did not attempt
      to see Lucy and Sophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next Indian mail brought the expected letter, giving an exact account
      of the acquirements and habits that would be required of Gilbert, with a
      promise of a home where he would be treated as a son, and of admission to
      the firm after due probation. The letter was so sensible and affectionate,
      that Mr. Kendal congratulated his son upon such an advantageous outset in
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert made slight reply, but the next morning Sophy sought Albinia out,
      and with some hesitation began to tell her that Gilbert was very anxious
      that she would intercede with papa not to send him to Calcutta.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You now, Sophy!&rsquo; cried Albinia. &lsquo;You who used to think nothing equal to
      India!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish it were I,&rsquo; said Sophy, &lsquo;but you know&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Albinia, coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy was too shy to begin on that tack, and dashed off on another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, mamma, he is so wretched. He can&rsquo;t bear to thwart papa, but he says
      it would break his heart to go so far away, and that he knows it would
      kill him to be confined to a desk in that climate.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You know papa thinks that nothing would confirm his health so much as a
      few years without an English winter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One&rsquo;s own instinct&mdash;&rsquo; began Sophy; then breaking off, she added,
      &lsquo;Mamma, you never were for the bank.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I used not to see the expediency, and I did not like the parting; but now
      I understand your father&rsquo;s wishes, and the sort of allegiance he feels
      towards India, so that Gilbert&rsquo;s reluctance will be a great mortification
      to him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So it will,&rsquo; said Sophy, mournfully, &lsquo;I am sure it is to me. I always
      looked forward to Gilbert&rsquo;s going to Talloon, and seeing the dear old
      bearer, and taking all my presents there, but you see, of course, mamma,
      he cannot bear to go&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sophy, dear,&rsquo; said Albinia, &lsquo;you have been thinking me a very
      hard-hearted woman this last month. I have been longing to have it out.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not hard-hearted,&rsquo; said Sophy, looking down, &lsquo;only I had always thought
      you different from other people.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you considered that I was worldly, and not romantic enough. Is that
      it, Sophy?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thought you knew how to value her for herself, so good and so admirable&mdash;a
      lady in everything&mdash;with such perfect manners. I thought you would
      have been pleased and proud that Gilbert&rsquo;s choice was so much nobler than
      beauty, or rank, or fashion could make it,&rsquo; said Sophy, growing
      enthusiastic as she went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, my dear, perhaps I am.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But, mamma, you have done all you could to separate them: you have shut
      Genevieve up in a convent, and you want to banish him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It sounds very grand, and worthy of a cruel step-dame,&rsquo; said Albinia;
      &lsquo;but, my dear, though I do think Genevieve in herself an admirable
      creature, worthy of any one&rsquo;s love, what am I to think of the way Gilbert
      has taken to show his admiration?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And is it not very hard,&rsquo; cried Sophy, &lsquo;that even you, who own all her
      excellences, should turn against him, and give in to all this miserable
      conventionality, that wants riches and station, and trumpery worldly
      things, and crushes down true love in two young hearts?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sophy dear, I am afraid the love is not proved to be true in the one
      heart, and I am sure there is none in the other!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mamma! &lsquo;Tis her self-command&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nonsense! His attentions are nothing but distress to her! Sensible
      grown-up young women are not apt to be flattered by importunity from silly
      boys. Has he told you otherwise?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He thinks&mdash;he hopes, at least&mdash;and I am sure&mdash;it is all
      stifled by her sense of duty, and fear of offending you, or appearing
      mercenary.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All delusion!&rsquo; said Albinia; &lsquo;there&rsquo;s not a spark of consciousness about
      her! I see you don&rsquo;t like to believe it, but it is my great comfort. Think
      how she would suffer if she did love him! Nay, think, before you are angry
      with me for not promoting it, how it would bring them into trouble and
      disgrace with all the world, even if your father consented. Have you once
      thought how it would appear to him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You can persuade papa to anything!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sophy! you ought to know your father better than to say that!&rsquo; cried
      Albinia, as if it had been disrespect to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you think he would never allow it! You really think that such a
      creature as Genevieve, as perfect a lady as ever existed, must always be a
      victim to these hateful rules about station.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Albinia, &lsquo;certainly not; but if she were in the very same rank,
      if all else were suitable, Gilbert&rsquo;s age would make the pursuit
      ridiculous.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only three years younger,&rsquo; sighed Sophy. &lsquo;But if they were the same age?
      Do you mean that no one ever ought to marry, if they love ever so much,
      where the station is different?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, but that they must not do so lightly, but try the love first to see
      whether it be worth the sacrifice. If an attachment last through many
      years of adverse circumstances, I think the happiness of the people has
      been shown to depend on each other, but I don&rsquo;t think it safe to disregard
      disparities till there has been some test that the love is the right
      stuff, or else they may produce ill-temper, regrets, and unhappiness, all
      the rest of their lives.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If Gilbert went on for years, mamma?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I did not say that, Sophy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Suppose,&rsquo; continued the eager girl, &lsquo;he went out to Calcutta, and worked
      these five years, and was made a partner. Then he would be two-and-twenty,
      nobody could call him too young, and he would come home, and ask papa&rsquo;s
      consent, and you&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I <i>should</i> call that constancy,&rsquo; said Albinia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And he would take her out to Calcutta, and have no Drurys and Osborns to
      bother her! Oh! It would be beautiful! I would watch over her while he was
      gone! I&rsquo;ll go and tell him!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stop, Sophy, not from me&mdash;that would never do. I don&rsquo;t think papa
      would think twenty-two such a great age&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But he would have loved her five years!&rsquo; said Sophy. &lsquo;And you said
      yourself that would be constancy!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;True, but, Sophy, I have known a youth who sailed broken-hearted, and met
      a lady &ldquo;just in the style&rdquo; of the former one, on board the steamer&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy made a gesture of impatient disdain, and repeated, &lsquo;Do you allow me
      to tell Gilbert that this is the way?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not from me. I hold out no hope. I don&rsquo;t believe Genevieve cares for him,
      and I don&rsquo;t know whether his father would consent&mdash;&rsquo; but seeing
      Sophy&rsquo;s look of disappointment, &lsquo;I see no harm in your suggesting it, for
      it is his only chance with either of them, and would be the proof that his
      affection was good for something.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you think her worth it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think her worth anything in the world&mdash;the more for her behaviour
      in this matter. I only doubt if Gilbert have any conception how much she
      is worth.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Away went Sophy in a glow that made her almost handsome, while Albinia, as
      usual, wondered at her own imprudence.
    </p>
    <p>
      At luncheon Sophy avoided her eye, and looked crestfallen, and when
      afterwards she gave a mute inquiring address, shook her head impatiently.
      It was plain that she had failed, and was too much pained and shamed by
      his poorness of spirit to be able as yet to speak of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next came Gilbert, who pursued Albinia to the morning-room to entreat her
      interference in his behalf, appealing piteously to her kindness; but she
      was obdurate. If any remonstrance were offered to his father, it must be
      by himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert fell into a state of misery, threw himself about upon the chairs,
      and muttered in the fretfulness of childish despair something about its
      being very hard, when he was owner of half the town, to be sent into exile&mdash;it
      was like jealousy of his growing up and being master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take care, Gilbert!&rsquo; said Albinia, with a flash of her eye that he felt
      to his backbone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t mean it,&rsquo; cried Gilbert, springing towards her in supplication.
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve heard it said, that&rsquo;s all, and was as angry as you, but when a
      fellow is beside himself with misery at being driven away from all he
      loves&mdash;not a friend to help him&mdash;how can he keep from thinking
      all sorts of things?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wonder what people dare to say it!&rsquo; cried Albinia wrathfully; but he
      did not heed, he was picturing his own future misfortunes&mdash;toil&mdash;climate&mdash;fevers&mdash;choleras&mdash;Thugs&mdash;coups
      de soleil&mdash;genuine dread and repugnance working him up to positive
      agony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gilbert,&rsquo; said Albinia, &lsquo;this is trumpery self-torture! You know this is
      a mere farrago that you have conjured up. Your father would neither thrust
      you into danger, nor compel you to do anything to which you had a
      reasonable aversion. Go and be a man about it in one way or the other!
      Either accept or refuse, but don&rsquo;t make these childish lamentations. They
      are cowardly! I should be ashamed of little Maurice if he behaved so!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you will not speak a word for me!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No! Speak for yourself!&rsquo; and she left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Days passed on, till she began to think that, after all, Gilbert preferred
      Calcutta, cholera, Thugs, and all, to facing his father; but at last, he
      must have taken heart from his extremity, for Mr. Kendal said, with less
      vexation than she had anticipated, &lsquo;So our plans are overthrown. Gilbert
      tells me he has an invincible dislike to Calcutta. Had you any such idea?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not till your cousin&rsquo;s letter arrived. What did you say to him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He was so much afraid of vexing me that I was obliged to encourage him to
      speak freely, and I found that he had always had a strong distaste to and
      dread of India. I told him I wished he had made me aware of it sooner, and
      desired to know what profession he really preferred. He spoke of Oxford
      and the Bar, and so I suppose it must be. I do not wonder that he wishes
      to follow his Traversham friends, and as they are a good set, I hope there
      may not be much temptation. I see you are not satisfied, Albinia, yet your
      wishes were one of my motives.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you&mdash;once I should,&rsquo; said Albinia; &lsquo;but, Edmund, I see how
      wrong it was to have concealed anything from you;&rsquo; and thereupon she
      informed him of Gilbert&rsquo;s passion for Genevieve Durant, which astonished
      him greatly, though he took it far less seriously than she had expected,
      and was not displeased at having been kept in ignorance and spared the
      trouble of taking notice of it, and thus giving it importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It will pass off,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;She has too much sense and principle to
      encourage him, and if you can get her out of Bayford for a few years he
      will be glad to have it forgotten.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor Genevieve! She must break up her grandmother&rsquo;s home after all!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It will be a great advantage to her. You used to say that it would be
      most desirable for her to see more of the world. Away from this place she
      might marry well.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Any one&rsquo;s son but yours,&rsquo; said Albinia, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The connexion would be worse here than anywhere else; but I was not
      thinking of any one in our rank of life. There are many superior men in
      trade with whom she might be very happy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor child!&rsquo; sighed Albinia. &lsquo;I cannot feel that it is fair that she
      should be banished for Gilbert&rsquo;s faults; and I am sorry for the school;
      you cannot think how much the tone was improving.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If it could be done without hurting her feelings, I should gladly give
      her a year at some superior finishing school, which might either qualify
      her for a governess, or enable her to make this one more profitable.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! thank you!&rsquo; cried Albinia; &lsquo;yet I doubt. However, her services would
      be quite equivalent in any school to the lessons she wants. I&rsquo;ll write to
      Mrs. Elwood&mdash;&rsquo; and she was absorbed in the register-office in her
      brain, when Mr. Kendal continued&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is quite unexpected. I could not have supposed the boy so foolish!
      However, if you please, I will speak to him, tell him that I was unaware
      of his folly, and insist on his giving it up.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should be very glad if you would.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert was called, and the result was more satisfactory than Albinia
      thought that Genevieve deserved. His frenzy had tended to wear itself out,
      and he had been so dreadfully alarmed about India and his father, that in
      his relief, gratitude, and fear of being sent out, he was ready to promise
      anything. Before his father he could go into no rhapsodies, and could only
      be miserably confused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Personally,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal, &lsquo;it is creditable that you should be
      attracted by such estimable qualities, but these are not the sole
      consideration. Equality of station is almost as great a requisite as these
      for producing comfort or respectability, and nothing but your youth and
      ignorance could excuse your besetting any young woman with importunities
      which she had shown to be disagreeable to her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no outcry of despair, only a melancholy muttering. Then Mr.
      Kendal pronounced his decree in terms more explicit than those in which
      Albinia had exacted the promise. He said nothing about persecution, nor
      was he unreasonable enough to command an instant immolation of the
      passion; he only insisted that Gilbert should pay no marked attention, and
      attempt no unsanctioned or underhand communication. Unless he thought he
      had sufficient self-command to abstain, his father must take &lsquo;further
      measures.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As if fearing that this must mean &lsquo;Kendal and Kendal,&rsquo; he raised his head,
      and with a deep sigh undertook for his own self-command. Mr. Kendal laid
      his hand on his shoulder with kind pity, told him he was doing right, and
      that while he acted openly and obediently, he should always meet with
      sympathy and consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two difficult points remained&mdash;the disposing of the young people.
      Gilbert was still over young for the university, as well as very backward
      and ill-prepared, and the obstinate remains of the cough made his father
      unwilling to send him from home. And his presence made Genevieve&rsquo;s absence
      necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      The place had begun to loom in the distance. A former governess of
      Albinia&rsquo;s, who would have done almost anything to please her, had lately
      been left a widow, and established herself in a suburb of London, with a
      small party of pupils. She had just begun to feel the need of an
      additional teacher, and should gladly receive Genevieve, provided she
      fulfilled certain requisites, of which, luckily, French pronunciation
      stood the foremost. The terms were left to Albinia, who could scarcely
      believe her good fortune, and went in haste to discuss the matter with the
      Belmarches.
    </p>
    <p>
      It almost consoled her for what she had been exceedingly ashamed to
      announce, the change of purpose with regard to Gilbert, which was a
      sentence of banishment to the object of his folly. Nothing pained her more
      than the great courtesy and kindness of the two old ladies to whom it was
      such a cruel stroke, they evidently felt for her, and appeared to catch at
      Mrs. Elwood&rsquo;s offer, and when Albinia proposed that her salary should be a
      share in the instructions of the masters, agreed that this was the very
      thing they had felt it their duty to provide for her, if they had been
      able to bring themselves to part with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So,&rsquo; said good Madame Belmarche, smiling sadly, &lsquo;you see it has been for
      the dear child&rsquo;s real good that our weakness has been conquered.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Genevieve was written to, and consented to everything, and when Mr. Kendal
      took Gilbert away to visit an old friend, his wife called for Genevieve at
      the convent to bring her home. Albinia could not divest herself of some
      curiosity and excitement in driving up to the old-fashioned red brick
      house, with two tall wings projecting towards the street, and the front
      door in the centre between them, with steps down to it. She had not been
      without hopes of a parlour with a grille, or at least that a lay sister
      would open the door; but she saw nothing but a very ordinary-looking old
      maid-servant, and close behind her was Genevieve, with her little box,
      quite ready&mdash;no excuse for seeing anything or anybody else.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Genevieve were sad at the proposal of leaving home and going among
      strangers, she took care to hide all that could pain Mrs. Kendal, and her
      cheerful French spirit really enjoyed the prospect of new scenes, and
      bounded with enterprise at the hope of a new life and fresh field of
      exertion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps, after all,&rsquo; she said, smiling, &lsquo;they may make of me something
      really useful and valuable, and it will all be owing to you, dear madame.
      Drawing and Italian! When I can teach them, I shall be able to make
      grandmamma easy for life!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Genevieve skipped out of the carriage and into her aunt&rsquo;s arms, as if
      alive only to the present delight of being at home again. It was a
      contrast to Sophy&rsquo;s dolorous visage. Poor Sophy! she was living in a
      perpetual strife with the outward tokens of sulkiness, forcing herself
      against the grain to make civil answers, and pretend to be interested when
      she felt wretched and morose. That Gilbert, after so many ravings, should
      have relinquished, from mere cowardice, that one hope of earning Genevieve
      by honourable exertion, had absolutely lowered her trust in the exalting
      power of love, and her sense of justice revolted against the decision that
      visited the follies of the guilty upon the innocent. She was yearning over
      her friend with all her heart, pained at the separation, and longing
      fervently to make some demonstration, but the greater her wish, the worse
      was her reserve. She spent all her money upon a beautiful book as a
      parting gift, and kept it beside her, missing occasion after occasion of
      presenting it, and falling at each into a perfect agony behind that
      impalpable, yet impassable, barrier of embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not till the very last evening, when Genevieve had actually wished
      her good-bye and left the house, that she grew desperate. She hastily put
      on bonnet and cloak, and pursued Genevieve up the street, overtaking her
      at last, and causing her to look round close to her own door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear Miss Sophy,&rsquo; cried Genevieve, &lsquo;what is the matter? You are quite
      overcome.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This book&mdash;&rsquo; said Sophy&mdash;it was all she could say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Love&mdash;yes,&rsquo; said Genevieve. &lsquo;Admiration&mdash;no.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You shall not say that,&rsquo; cried Sophy. &lsquo;I have found what is really
      dignified and disinterested, and you must let me admire you, Jenny, it
      makes me comfortable.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Genevieve smiled. &lsquo;I would not commit an egoism,&rsquo; she said; but if the
      sense of admiration do you good, I wish it had a worthier cause.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s no one to admire but you,&rsquo; said Sophy. &lsquo;I think it very unfair to
      send you away, and though it is nobody&rsquo;s fault, I hate good sense and the
      way of the world!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! do not talk so. I am only overwhelmed with wonder at the goodness I
      have experienced. If it had happened with any other family, oh! how
      differently I should have been judged! Oh! when I think of Mrs. Kendal, I
      am ready to weep with gratitude!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, mamma is mamma, and not like any one else, but even she is obliged
      to be rational, and do the injustice, whatever she feels,&rsquo; said Sophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! not injustice&mdash;kindness! I shall be able to earn more for
      grandmamma!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is injustice!&rsquo; said Sophy, &lsquo;not hers, perhaps, but of the world! It
      makes me so angry, to think that you&mdash;you should never do anything
      but wear yourself out in drudging over tiresome little children&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Little children are my brothers and sisters, as I never had any,&rsquo; said
      Genevieve. &lsquo;Oh! I always loved them, they make a home wherever they are. I
      am thankful that my vocation is among them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In dread of a token from Gilbert, Genevieve would not notice it, but
      pursued, &lsquo;You must come in and rest&mdash;you must have my aunt&rsquo;s salts.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No&mdash;no&mdash;&rsquo; said Sophy, &lsquo;not there&mdash;&rsquo; as Genevieve would
      have taken her to the little parlour, but opening the door of the
      school-room, she sank breathless into a sitting position on the carpetless
      boards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Genevieve shut the door, and kneeling down, found Sophy&rsquo;s arms thrown
      round her, pressing her almost to strangulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! I wanted to do it&mdash;I never could wont you have the book,
      Genevieve? It is my keepsake&mdash;only I could not give it because&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it your keepsake, indeed, dear Miss Sophy?&rsquo; said Genevieve. &lsquo;Oh! if it
      is yours&mdash;how I shall value it&mdash;but it is too beautiful&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing is too beautiful for you, Genevieve,&rsquo; said Sophy fervently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And it is your gift! But I am frightened&mdash;it must have cost&mdash;!&rsquo; 
      began Genevieve, still a little on her guard. &lsquo;Dear, dear Miss Sophy,
      forgive me if I do seem ungrateful, but indeed I ought to ask&mdash;if&mdash;if
      it is all your own gift?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mine? yes!&rsquo; said Sophy, on the borders of offence. &lsquo;I know what you mean,
      Genevieve, but you may trust me. I would not take you in.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Genevieve was blushing intensely, but taking courage she bestowed a shower
      of ardent embraces and expressions of gratitude, mingled with excuses for
      her precaution. &lsquo;Oh! it was so very kind in Miss Sophy,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;it
      would be such a comfort to remember, she had feared she too was angry with
      her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Angry? oh, no!&rsquo; cried Sophy, her heart quite unlocked; &lsquo;but the more I
      loved and admired, the more I could not speak. And if they drive you to be
      a governess? If you had a situation like what we read of?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps I shall not,&rsquo; said Genevieve, laughing. &lsquo;Every one has been so
      good to me hitherto! And then I am not reduced from anything grander. I
      shall always have the children, you know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How I should hate them!&rsquo; quoth Sophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They are my pleasure. Besides I have always thought it a blessing that my
      business in life, though so humble, should be what may do direct good. If
      only I do not set them a bad example, or teach them any harm.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not much danger of that,&rsquo; said Sophy, smiling. &lsquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t believe it
      will be your lot all your life. You will find some one who will know how
      to love you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Genevieve, &lsquo;I am not in a position for marriage&mdash;grandmamma
      has often told me so!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Things sometimes happen,&rsquo; pursued Sophy. &lsquo;Mamma said if Gilbert had been
      older, or even if&mdash;if he had been in earnest and steady enough to
      work for you in India, then it might&mdash;And surely if Gilbert could
      care for you&mdash;people higher and deeper than he would like you better
      still.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush,&rsquo; said Genevieve; &lsquo;they would only see the objections more strongly.
      No, do not put these things in my head. I know that unless a teacher hold
      her business as her mission, and put all other schemes out of her mind,
      she will work with an absent, distracted, half-hearted attention, and fail
      of the task that the good God has committed to her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you would never even wish&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It would be seeking pomps and vanities to wish,&rsquo; said Genevieve; &lsquo;a
      school-room is a good safe cloister, probably less dull than the convent.
      If I wish at all, it will be that I may be well shut up there, for I know
      that in spite of myself my manners are different from your English ones. I
      cannot make them otherwise, and that amuses people; and I cannot help
      liking to please, and so I become excited. I enjoy society so much that it
      is not safe for me! So don&rsquo;t be sorry, dear Sophy, it is a fit penance for
      the vanity that elated me too much that evening at Fairmead!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle Belmarche was here attracted by the voices. Sophy started up
      from the ground, made some unintelligible excuse, and while Mademoiselle
      was confounded with admiration at the sight of the book, inflicted another
      boa-constrictor embrace, and hurried away.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Planets hostile to the tender passion must have been in the ascendant, for
      the result of Captain Ferrars&rsquo;s pursuit of his brother to Italy was the
      wholesome certainty that his own slender portion was all he had to reckon
      upon. Before returning to Canada, he came to Bayford to pour out his
      troubles to his cousin, and to induce her, if he could induce no one else,
      to advise his immediate marriage. It was the first time he had been really
      engaged, and his affection had not only stood three months&rsquo; absence, but
      had so much elevated his shatter-brained though frank and honest
      temperament, that Albinia conceived a high opinion of &lsquo;Emily,&rsquo; and did her
      best to persuade him to be patient, and wait for promotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy likewise approved of him this time, perhaps because he was so
      opposite a specimen of the genus lover from that presented by her brother.
      Gilbert had not been able to help enjoying himself while from home, but
      his spirits sank on his return; he lay about on the grass in doleful
      dejection, studied little but L. E. L., lost appetite, and reproachfully
      fondled his cough; but Albinia was now more compassionate than Sophy, whom
      she was obliged to rebuke for an unsisterly disregard toward his woes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t help it,&rsquo; said Sophy; &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t believe in him now!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, you ought to believe that he is really unhappy, and be more gentle
      and considerate with him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If it had been earnest, he would have sacrificed himself instead of
      Genevieve.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! Sophy, some day you will learn to make excuses for other people, and
      not be so intolerant.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never make excuses.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Except for Maurice,&rsquo; said Albinia. &lsquo;If you viewed other people as you do
      him, your judgments would be gentler.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy&rsquo;s conscientiousness, like her romance, was hard, high, and strict;
      but while she had as little mercy on herself as on others, and while there
      were some soft spots in her adamantine judgment, there was hope that these
      would spread, and, without lowering her tone, make her more merciful.
    </p>
    <p>
      She corresponded constantly with Genevieve, who seemed very happily
      placed; Mrs. Elwood was delighted with her, and she with Mrs. Elwood; and
      her lively letters showed no signs of pining for home. Sophy felt as if it
      were a duty to her friend, to do what in her lay to prevent the two old
      ladies from being dull, and spent an hour with them every week, not
      herself contributing much to their amusement, but pleasing them by the
      attention, and hearing much that was very curious of their old-world
      recollections.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ever since that unlucky penny-club-day, when she had declared that she
      hated poor people, she had been let alone on that subject; and though
      principle had made her use her needle in their behalf, shyness and reserve
      had kept her back from all intercourse with them; but in her wish to
      compensate for Genevieve&rsquo;s absence, she volunteered to take charge of her
      vacant Sunday-school class, and obtained leave to have the girls at home
      on the afternoons for an hour and a half. This was enough for one who
      worked as she did, making a conscience of every word, and toiling to
      prepare her lessons, writing out her questions beforehand, and begging for
      advice upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear,&rsquo; said Albinia, &lsquo;you must alter this&mdash;you see this question
      does not grow out of the last answer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Sophy, &lsquo;that must have been what puzzled them last Sunday:
      they want connexion.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing like logic to teach one to be simple,&rsquo; said Albinia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t see the use of all this trouble,&rsquo; put in Lucy. &lsquo;Why can&rsquo;t you ask
      them just what comes into your head, as I always do?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Suppose mistakes came into my head.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! they would not find it out if they did! I declare!&mdash;what&rsquo;s this&mdash;Persian?
      Are you going to teach them Persian?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No; it is Greek. You see it is a piece of a Psalm, a quotation rather
      different in the New Testament. I wrote it down to ask papa what it is in
      Hebrew.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By-the-bye, Sophy,&rsquo; continued Lucy, &lsquo;how could you let Susan Price come
      to church with lace sleeves&mdash;absolute lace sleeves!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Had she?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&mdash;you never see anything! Mamma, would not it be more sensible
      to keep their dress in order, than to go poking into Hebrew, which can&rsquo;t
      be of use to any one?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was more reason than might appear in what Lucy said: the girls of
      her class were more orderly, and fonder of her than Sophy&rsquo;s of the grave
      young lady whose earnestness oppressed them, and whose shyness looked
      dislike and pride. As to finding fault with their dress, she privately
      told Albinia that she could not commit such a discourtesy, and was
      answered that no one but Mrs. Dusautoy need interfere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will go and ask Mrs. Dusautoy what she wishes,&rsquo; said Albinia. &lsquo;I should
      be glad if she would modify Lucy&rsquo;s sumptuary laws. To fall foul of every
      trifle only makes the girls think of their dress.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia found Mrs. Dusautoy busied in writing notes on mourning paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here is a note I had written to you,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;I am sending over to
      Hadminster to see if any of the curates can take the services to-morrow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia looked at the note while Mrs. Dusautoy wrote on hurriedly. She
      read that there could be no daily services at present, the Vicar having
      been summoned to Paris by the sudden death of Mrs. Cavendish Dusautoy. As
      the image of a well-endowed widow, always trying to force her way into
      higher society, arose before Albinia, she could hardly wait till the
      letter was despatched, to break out in amazement,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Was she a relation of yours? Even the name never made me think of it!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is a pity she cannot have the gratification of hearing it, poor
      woman,&rsquo; said Mrs. Dusautoy, &lsquo;but it is a fact that she did poor George
      Dusautoy the honour to marry him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Dusautoy&rsquo;s brother?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ay&mdash;he was a young surgeon, just set up in practice, exactly like
      John&mdash;nay, some people thought him still finer-looking. She was a
      Miss Greenaway Cavendish, a stock-broker&rsquo;s heiress of a certain age.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; expressively cried Albinia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You may say so,&rsquo; returned Mrs. Dusautoy. &lsquo;She made him put away his
      profession, and set up for taste and elegant idleness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And he submitted?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There was a great deal of the meek giant in him, and he believed
      implicitly in the honour she had done him. It would have been very
      touching, if it had not been so provoking, to see how patiently and humbly
      that fine young man gave up all that would have made him happy, to bend to
      her caprices and pretensions.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did you ever see them together?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I never saw her at all, and him only once. I never knew John really
      savage but once, and that was at her not letting him come to our wedding;
      but she did give him leave of absence for one fortnight, when we were at
      Lauriston. How happy the brothers were! It did one good to hear their
      great voices about the house; and they were like boys on a stolen frolic,
      when John took him to prescribe for some of our poor people. He used to
      talk of bringing us his little son&mdash;the one pleasure of his life&mdash;but
      he never was allowed. Oh, how I used to long to stir up a mutiny!&rsquo; cried
      Mrs. Dusautoy, quite unknowing that she ruled her own lion with a leash of
      silk. &lsquo;If she had appreciated him, it would have been bearable; but to her
      he was no more than the handsome young doctor, whom she had made a
      gentleman, and not a very good piece of work of it either! Little she
      recked of the great loving heart that had thrown itself away on her, and
      the patience that bore with her; and she tried to hinder all the liberal
      bountiful actions that were all he cared to do with his means! I wish the
      boy may remember him!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How long has he been dead?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;These ten years. He was drowned in a lake storm in Switzerland&mdash;people
      clung to him, and he could not swim. It was John&rsquo;s one great grief&mdash;he
      cannot mention him even now. And really,&rsquo; she added, smiling, &lsquo;I do
      believe he has brought himself to fancy it was a very happy marriage. She
      has always been very civil; but she has been chiefly abroad, and never
      would take his advice about sending her boy to school.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What becomes of him now?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is our charge. She was on the way home from Italy, when she was taken
      ill at Paris, and died at the end of the week.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How old is he?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;About nineteen, I fancy. He must have had an odd sort of education; but
      if he is a nice lad, it will be a great pleasure to John to have something
      young about the house.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was thinking that Mr. Dusautoy hardly wanted more cares.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So have I,&rsquo; said her friend, smiling, &lsquo;and I have been laying a plot
      against him. You see, he is as strong as a lion, and never yet was too
      tired to sleep; but it is rather a tempting of Providence to keep 3589
      people and fourteen services in a week resting upon one man!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Exactly what his churchwarden has preached to him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Moreover, he cannot be in two places at once, let alone half-a-dozen.
      Now, my Lancashire people have written in quest of a title for holy orders
      for a young man who has just gone through Cambridge with great credit, and
      it strikes me that he might at once help John, and cram Master Algernon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And Gilbert!&rsquo; cried Albinia. &lsquo;Oh, if you will import a tutor for Gilbert,
      we shall be for ever beholden to you!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I had thought of him. I have no doubt that he is much better taught than
      Algernon; but I am not afraid of this poor fellow bringing home bad
      habits, and they will be good companions. I reckon upon you and Mr. Kendal
      as great auxiliaries, and I don&rsquo;t think John will be able to withstand our
      united forces.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      On the way home, on emerging from the alley, Albinia encountered Gilbert,
      just parting with another youth, who walked off quickly on the Tremblam
      road, while she inquired who it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That?&rsquo; said Gilbert; &lsquo;oh! that was young Tritton. He has been away
      learning farming in Scotland. We speak when we meet, for old acquaintance
      sake and that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bayford mind was diverted from the romance of Genevieve, by the
      enormous fortune of the Vicar&rsquo;s nephew, whose capital was in their mouths
      and imaginations swelled into his yearly income. Swarms of cards of
      inquiry were left at the vicarage; and Mrs. Meadows and Lucy enjoyed the
      reflected dignity of being able to say that Mrs. Kendal was continually
      there. And so she was, for Mrs. Dusautoy was drooping, though more in body
      than visibly in spirit, and needed both companionship and assistance in
      supporting the charge left by her absent Atlas.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not gone a moment longer than necessary, and took her by surprise
      at last, while Albinia and Sophy were sitting on the lawn with her, when
      she welcomed the nephew and the Vicar, holding out a hand to each, and
      thanked them for taking care of &lsquo;Fanny.&rsquo; &lsquo;Here, Algernon,&rsquo; he continued,
      &lsquo;here are two of our best friends, Mrs. Kendal and Miss Sophy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a stiff bow from a stiff altitude. The youth was on the gigantic
      Dusautoy scale, looking taller even than his uncle, from his manner of
      holding himself with his chin somewhat elevated. He had a good ruddy
      sun-burnt complexion, shining brown hair, and regular features; and
      Albinia could respond heartily to the good Vicar&rsquo;s exclamation, as he
      followed her down to the gate for the sake of saying,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well-grown lad, isn&rsquo;t that? And a very good-hearted fellow too, poor boy&mdash;the
      very picture of his dear father. Well, and how has Fanny been?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He stayed to be reassured that his return was all his Fanny wanted, and
      then hurried back to her, while Albinia and Sophy pursued their way down
      the hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;News for grandmamma. We must give her a particular description of the
      hero.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How ugly he thought me!&rsquo; said Sophy, quaintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear, I believe that is the first thing you think of when you meet a
      stranger!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I saw it this time,&rsquo; returned Sophy. &lsquo;His chin went up in the air at
      once. He set me down for Mrs. Kendal, and you for Miss Sophy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nonsense,&rsquo; said Albinia, for the inveterate youthfulness of her bright
      complexion and sunny hair was almost a sore subject with her. &lsquo;Your always
      fancying that every one is disgusted with you, is as silly as if you
      imagined yourself transcendently beautiful. It is mere self-occupation,
      and helps to make you blunt and shy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mamma,&rsquo; said Sophy, &lsquo;tell me one thing. Did you ever think yourself
      pretty?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have thought myself looking so, under favourable circumstances, but
      that&rsquo;s all. You are as far from ugliness as I am, and have as little need
      to think of it. As far as features go, there&rsquo;s the making of a much
      handsomer woman in you than in me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy laughed. A certain yearning for personal beauty was a curious part
      of her character, and she would have been ashamed to own the pleasure
      those few words had given her, or how much serenity and forbearance they
      were worth; and her good-humour was put to the proof that evening, for
      grandmamma had a tea-party, bent on extracting the full description of the
      great Algernon Greenaway Cavendish Dusautoy, Esquire. Lucy&rsquo;s first sight
      was less at her ease. Elizabeth Osborn, with whom she kept up a fitful
      intimacy, summoned her mysteriously into her garden, to show her a
      peep-hole through a little dusty window in the tool-house, whence could be
      descried the vicarage garden, and Mr. Cavendish Dusautoy, as, with a cigar
      in his mouth, and his hands in his pockets,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &lsquo;Stately stept he east the wa&rsquo;, and stately stept he west.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      Lucy was so much amused, that she could not help reporting it at home,
      where Gilbert forgot his sorrows, in building up a mischievous romance in
      honour of the hole in the &lsquo;sweet and lovely wall.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But the parents&rsquo; feud did not seem likely to hold out. A hundred thousand
      pounds on one side of the wall, and three single daughters on the other,
      Mrs. Osborn was not the woman to trust to the &lsquo;wall&rsquo;s hole;&rsquo; and so Mr.
      Dusautoy&rsquo;s enemy laid down her colours; and he was too kind-hearted to
      trace her sudden politeness to the source.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dusautoy acceded to the scheme devised by his wife, and measures were
      at once taken for engaging the curate. When Albinia went to talk the
      matter over at the parsonage, Lucy accompanied her; but the object of her
      curiosity was not in the room; and when she had heard that he was fond of
      drawing, and that his horses were to be kept at the King&rsquo;s Head stables,
      the conversation drifted away, and she grew restless, and begged Mrs.
      Dusautoy to allow her to replenish the faded bouquets on the table. No
      sooner was she in the garden, than Mrs. Dusautoy put on an arch look, and
      lowering her voice, said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! it is such fun! He does despise us so immensely.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Despise&mdash;you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is a good, boy, faithful to his training. Now his poor mother&rsquo;s axioms
      were, that the English are vulgar, country English more vulgar, Fanny
      Dusautoy the most vulgar! I wish we always as heartily accepted what we
      are taught.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He must be intolerable.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, he is very condescending and patronizing to the savages. He really is
      fond of his uncle; and John is so much hurt it I notice his peculiarities,
      that I have been dying to have my laugh out.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can Mr. Dusautoy bear with pretension?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is not pretension, only calm faith in the lessons of his youth. Look,&rsquo; 
      she added, becoming less personal at Lucy&rsquo;s re-entrance, and pointing to a
      small highly-varnished oil-painting of a red terra cotta vase, holding a
      rose, a rhododendron before it, and half a water-melon grinning behind,
      newly severed by a knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is that what people bring home from Italy now-a-days?&rsquo; said Albinia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is an original production.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did Mr. Cavendish Dusautoy do that?&rsquo; cried Lucy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Genre is his style,&rsquo; was the reply. &lsquo;His mother was resolved he should be
      an amateur, and I give his master great credit.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Especially for that not being a Madonna,&rsquo; said Albinia. &lsquo;I congratulate
      you on his having so safe an amusement.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes; it disposes of him and of the spare room. He cannot exist without an
      atelier.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then the Vicar entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! Algernon&rsquo;s picture,&rsquo; began he, who had never been known to look at
      one, except the fat cattle in the Illustrated News. &lsquo;What do you think of
      it? Has he not made a good hand of the pitcher?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia gratified him by owning that the pitcher was round; and Lucy was
      in perfect rapture at the &lsquo;dear little spots&rsquo; in the rhododendron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A poor way of spending a lad&rsquo;s time,&rsquo; said the uncle; &lsquo;but it is better
      than nothing; and I call the knife very good: I declare you might take it
      up,&rsquo; and he squeezed up his eyes to enhance the illusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      A slow and wide opening of the door admitted the lofty presence of
      Algernon Cavendish Dusautoy, with another small picture in his hand.
      Becoming aware of the visitors, he saluted them with a dignified movement
      of his head, and erecting his chin, gazed at them over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So you have brought us another picture, Algernon,&rsquo; said his uncle. &lsquo;Mrs.
      Kendal has just been admiring your red jar.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you a taste for art?&rsquo; demanded Mr. Cavendish Dusautoy, turning to
      her with magnificent suavity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I used to be very fond of drawing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Genre is my style,&rsquo; he pursued, almost overthrowing her gravity by the
      original of his aunt&rsquo;s imitation. &lsquo;I took lessons of old Barbouille&mdash;excellent
      master. Truth and nature, those were his maxims; and from the moment I
      heard them, I said, &ldquo;This is my man.&rdquo; We used positively to live in the
      Borghese. There!&rsquo; as he walked backwards, after adjusting his production
      in the best light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A snipe,&rsquo; said Albinia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A snipe that I killed in the Pontine marshes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is very good shooting about Anxur,&rsquo; said Albinia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have been at Rome?&rsquo; He permitted himself a little animation at
      discovering any one within the pale of civilization.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For one fortnight in the course of a galloping tour with my two
      brothers,&rsquo; said Albinia. &lsquo;All the Continent in one long vacation!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That was much to be regretted. It is my maxim to go through every museum
      thoroughly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t regret,&rsquo; said Albinia. &lsquo;I should be very sorry to give up my
      bright indistinct haze of glorious memories, though I was too young to
      appreciate all I saw.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For my part, I have grown up among works of art. My whole existence has
      been moulded on them, and I feel an inexpressible void without them. I
      shall be most happy to introduce you into my atelier, and show you my
      notes on the various Musees. I preserved them merely as a trifling
      memorial; but many connoisseurs have told me that I ought to print them as
      a Catalogue raisonnee, for private circulation, of course. I should be
      sorry to interfere with Murray, but on the whole I decided otherwise: I
      should be so much bored with applications.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Dusautoy&rsquo;s wicked glance had so nearly demolished the restraint on
      her friend&rsquo;s dimples, that she turned her back on her, and commended the
      finish of a solitary downy feather that lay detached beside the bird.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My maxim is truth to nature, at any cost of pains,&rsquo; said the youth, not
      exactly gratified, for homage was his native element, but graciously
      proceeding to point out the merits of the composition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia&rsquo;s composure could endure no more, and she took her leave, Mr.
      Dusautoy coming down the hill with her to repeat, and this time somewhat
      wistfully,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A fine lad, is he not, poor fellow?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With perfect sincerity, she could praise his good looks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He has had a quantity of sad stuff thrust on him by the people who have
      been about his poor mother,&rsquo; said Mr. Dusautoy. &lsquo;She could never bear to
      part with him, and no wonder, poor thing; and she must have let a very odd
      sort of people get about her abroad&mdash;they&rsquo;ve flattered that poor lad
      to the top of his bent, you see, but he&rsquo;s a very good boy for all that,
      very warm-hearted.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He must be very amiable for his mother to have been able to manage him
      all this while.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just what I say!&rsquo; cried the Vicar, his honest face clearing. &lsquo;Many youths
      would have run into all that is bad, brought up in that way; but only
      consider what disadvantages he has had! When we get him to see his real
      standing a little better&mdash;I say, could not you let us have your young
      people to come up this evening, have a little music, and make it lively? I
      suppose Fanny and I are growing old, though I never thought so before.
      Will you come, Lucy, there&rsquo;s a good girl, and bring your brother and
      sister? The lads must be capital friends.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy promised with sparkling eyes, and the Vicar strode off, saying he
      should depend on the three.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert &lsquo;supposed he was in for it,&rsquo; but &lsquo;did not see the use of it,&rsquo; he
      was sick of the name of &lsquo;that polysyllable,&rsquo; and &lsquo;should see enough of him
      when Mr. Hope came, worse luck.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The result of the evening was, that Lacy was enraptured at the discovery
      that this most accomplished hero sang Italian songs to the loveliest
      guitar in the world, and was very much offended with Sophy for wishing to
      know whether mamma really thought him so very clever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately after the Ordination arrived Mr. Hope, a very youthful, small,
      and delicate-looking man, whom Mr. Dusautoy could have lifted as easily as
      his own Fanny, with short sight, timid nature, scholarly habits, weak
      nerves, and an inaudible voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of great intellect, having read deeply, and reading still more deeply, he
      had the utmost dread of ladies, and not even his countrywoman, Mrs.
      Dusautoy, could draw him out. He threw his whole soul into the work,
      winning the hearts of the infant-school and the old women, but
      discomfiting the congregation by the weakness of his voice, and the length
      and depth of his sermons. There was one in especial which very few heard,
      and no one entered into except Sophy, who held an hour&rsquo;s argument over it
      with her father, till they arrived at such lengthy names of heresies, that
      poor grandmamma asked if it were right to talk Persian on a Sunday
      evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      He conscientiously tutored his two pupils, but there was no common ground
      between him and them. Excepting his extra intellect, there was no boyhood
      in him. A town-bred scholar, a straight constitutional upon a clean road
      was his wildest dream of exercise; he had never mounted a horse, did not
      know a chicken from a partridge, except on the table, was too
      short-sighted for pictures, and esteemed no music except Gregorians.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two youths were far more alive to his deficiencies than to his
      endowments: Algernon contemned him for being a book-seller&rsquo;s son, with
      nothing to live on but his fellowship and curacy, and Gilbert looked down
      on his ignorance of every matter of common life, and excessive
      bashfulness. Mr. Dusautoy would have had less satisfaction in the growing
      intimacy between the lads, had he known that it had been cemented by
      inveigling poor Mr. Hope into a marsh in search of cotton-grass, which, at
      Gilbert&rsquo;s instigation, Algernon avouched to be a new sort of Indian corn,
      grown in Italy for feeding silkworms.
    </p>
    <p>
      An intimacy there was, rather from constant intercourse than from positive
      liking. Gilbert saw through and disdained young Dusautoy&rsquo;s dulness and
      self-consequence; but good-natured, kindly, and unoccupied, he had no
      objection to associate with him, showing him English ways, trying to
      hinder him from needlessly exposing himself, and secretly amused with his
      pretension. Algernon, with his fine horses, expensive appointments, and
      lofty air, was neither a discreditable nor unpleasing companion. Mr.
      Kendal had given his son a horse, which, without costing the guineas that
      Algernon had &lsquo;refused&rsquo; for each of his steeds, was a very
      respectable-looking animal, and the two young gentlemen, starting on their
      daily ride, were a grand spectacle for more than little Maurice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert had suffered some eclipse. Once he had been the grand parti, the
      only indisputable gentleman, but now Mr. Cavendish Dusautoy had entirely
      surpassed him both in self-assertion and in the grounds for it. His
      incipient dandyisms faded into insignificance beside the splendours of the
      heir of thousands; and he, who among all his faults had never numbered
      conceit or forwardness, had little chance beside such an implicit believer
      in his own greatness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was Bayford likely to diminish that faith. The non-adorers might be
      easily enumerated&mdash;his uncle and aunt, his tutor, his groom, Mr. and
      Mrs. Kendal, Gilbert and Sophy; the rest all believed in him as thoroughly
      as he did in himself. His wealth was undoubted, his accomplishments were
      rated at his own advertisement, and his magnanimous condescension was
      esteemed at full value. Really handsome, good-natured and sociable, he
      delighted to instruct his worshippers by his maxims, and to bend
      graciously to their homage. The young ladies had but one cynosure! Few
      eyes were there that did not pursue his every movement, few hearts that
      did not bound at his approach, few tongues that did not chronicle his
      daily comings and goings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It would save much trouble,&rsquo; said Albinia, &lsquo;if a court circular could be
      put into the Bayford paper.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Kendals were the only persons whom Algernon regarded as in any way on
      a footing with him. Finding that the lady was a Ferrars, and had been in
      Italy, he regarded her as fit company, and whenever they met, favoured her
      with the chief and choicest of his maxims, little knowing how she and his
      aunt presumed to discuss him in private.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without being ill-disposed, he had been exceedingly ill taught; his
      mother, the child of a grasping vulgar father, had little religious
      impression, and that little had not been fostered by the lax habits of a
      self-expatriated Englishwoman, and very soon after his arrival at Bayford
      his disregard of ordinary English proprieties had made itself apparent. On
      the first Sunday he went to church in the morning, but spent the evening
      in pacing the garden with a cigar; and on the afternoon of that day week
      his aunt was startled by the sound of horse&rsquo;s hoofs on the road. Mr.
      Dusautoy was at school, and she started up, met the young gentleman, and
      asked him what strange mistake could have been made. He made her a slight
      bow, and loftily said he was always accustomed to ride at that hour! &lsquo;But
      not on Sunday!&rsquo; she exclaimed. He was not aware of any objection. She told
      him his uncle would be much displeased, he replied politely that he would
      account to his uncle for his conduct, begged her pardon, but he could not
      keep his horse waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Dusautoy went back, fairly cried at the thought of her husband&rsquo;s
      vexation, and the scandal to the whole town.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Vicar was, of course, intensely annoyed, though he still could make
      excuses for the poor boy, and laid all to the score of ignorance and
      foreign education. He made Algernon clearly understand that the Sunday
      ride must not be repeated. Algernon mumbled something about compromising
      his uncle and offending English prejudices, by which he reserved to
      himself the belief that he yielded out of magnanimity, not because he
      could not help it; but he could not forgive his aunt for her peremptory
      opposition; he became unpleasantly sullen and morose as regularly as the
      Sunday came round, and revenged himself by pacing the verandah with his
      cigar, or practising anything but sacred music on his key-bugle in his
      painting-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The youth was really fond of his uncle, but he had imbibed all his
      mother&rsquo;s contempt for her sister-in-law. Used to be wheedled by an
      idolizing mother, and to reign over her court of parasites, he had no
      notion of obeying, and a direct command or opposition roused his sullen
      temper of passive resistance. When he found &lsquo;that little nobody of a Mrs.
      John Dusautoy&rsquo; so far from being a flatterer, or an adorer of his
      perfections, inclined to laugh at him, and bent on keeping him in order,
      all the enmity of which he was capable arose in his mind, and though in
      general good-natured and not aggressive, he had a decided pleasure in
      doing what she disapproved, and thus asserting the dignity of a Greenaway
      Cavendish Dusautoy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The atelier was a happy invention. Certainly wearisome noises, and an
      aroma of Havannahs would now and then proceed therefrom, but he was
      employed there the chief part of the day, and fortunately his pictures
      were of small size, and took an infinite quantity of labour, so that they
      could not speedily outrun all the Vicarage walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      He favoured the University of Oxford by going up with Gilbert for
      matriculation, when, to the surprise of Mr. Hope, he was not plucked. They
      were to begin their residence at the Easter term. Mrs. Dusautoy did not
      confess even to Albinia how much she looked forward to Easter.
    </p>
    <p>
      In early spring, a sudden and short illness took away Madame Belmarche&rsquo;s
      brave spirit to its rest, after sixty years of exile and poverty,
      cheerfully borne.
    </p>
    <p>
      There had been no time to summon Genevieve, and her aunt would not send
      for her, but decided on breaking up the school, which could no longer be
      carried on, and going to live in the Hadminster convent. And thus, as Mr.
      Kendal hoped, all danger of renewed intercourse between his son and
      Genevieve ended. Gilbert looked pale and wretched, and Sophy hoped it was
      with compunction at having banished Genevieve at such a moment, but not a
      word was said&mdash;and that page of early romance was turned!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was a beautiful July afternoon, the air musical with midsummer hum, the
      flowers basking in the sunshine, the turf cool and green in the shade, and
      the breeze redolent of indescribable freshness and sweetness compounded of
      all fragrant odours, the present legacy of a past day&rsquo;s shower. Like the
      flowers themselves, Albinia was feeling the delicious repose of refreshed
      nature, as in her pretty pink muslin, her white drapery folded round her,
      and her bright hair unbonnetted, she sat reclining in a low garden chair,
      at the door of the conservatory, a little pale, a little weak, but with a
      sweet happy languor, a soft tender bloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a step in the conservatory, and before she could turn round, her
      brother Maurice bent over her, and kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Maurice! you have come after all!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, the school inspection is put off. How are you?&rsquo; as he sat down on
      the grass by her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, quite well! What a delicious afternoon we shall have! Edmund will be
      at home directly. Mrs. Meadows has absolutely let Gilbert take her to
      drink tea at the Drurys! Only I am sorry Sophy should miss you, for she
      was so good about going, because Lucy wanted to do something to her
      fernery. Of course you are come for Sunday, and the christening?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&mdash;that is, to throw myself on Dusautoy&rsquo;s mercy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We will send Mr. Hope to Fairmead,&rsquo; said Albinia, &lsquo;and see whether
      Winifred can make him speak. We can&rsquo;t spare the Vicar, for he is our
      godfather, and you must christen the little maiden.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thought the three elder ones were to be sponsors.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gilbert is shy,&rsquo; said Albinia, &lsquo;afraid of the responsibility, and perhaps
      he is almost too near, the very next to ourselves. His father would have
      preferred Mr. Dusautoy from the first, and only yielded to my wish. I wish
      you had come two minutes sooner, she was being paraded under that wall,
      but now she is gone in asleep.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Her father writes grand things of her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Does he?&rsquo; said Albinia, colouring and smiling at what could not be heard
      too often; &lsquo;he is tolerably satisfied with the young woman! And he thinks
      her like Edmund, and so she must be, for she is just like him. She will
      have such beautiful eyes. It is very good of her to take after him, since
      Maurice won&rsquo;t!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And she is to be another Albinia.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I represented the confusion, and how I always meant my daughter to be
      Winifred, but there&rsquo;s no doing anything with him! It is only to be a
      second name. A. W. K.! Think if she should marry a Mr. Ward!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, she would not be awkward, if she were so a-warded.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It wont spell, Maurice,&rsquo; cried Albinia, laughing as their nonsense, as
      usual, rose to the surface, &lsquo;but how is Winifred?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As well as could be hoped under the affliction of not being able to come
      and keep you in order.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She fancied me according to the former pattern,&rsquo; said Albinia, smiling,
      &lsquo;I could have shown her a better specimen, not that it was any merit, for
      there were no worries, and Edmund was so happy, that it was pleasure
      enough to watch him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was coming every day to judge for myself, but I thought things could
      not be very bad, while he wrote such flourishing accounts.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, there were no more ponds!&rsquo; said Albinia, &lsquo;and grandmamma happily was
      quite well, cured, I believe, by the excitement. Lucy took care of her,
      and Sophy read to me&mdash;how we have enjoyed those readings! Oh! and
      Aunt Gertrude has found a delightful situation for Genevieve, a
      barrister&rsquo;s family, with lots of little children&mdash;eighty pounds a
      year, and quite ready to value her, so she is off my mind.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Maurice, boy! come here,&rsquo; she called, as she caught sight of a creature
      prancing astride on one stick, and waving another. On perceiving a
      visitor, the urchin came careering up, bouncing full tilt upon her, and
      clasping her round with both his stalwart arms. &lsquo;Gently, gently, boy,&rsquo; she
      said, bending down, and looking with proud delight at her brother, as she
      held between her hands a face much like her own, as fair and freshly
      tinted, but with a peculiar squareness of contour, large blue eyes, with
      dark fringes, brimming over with mischief and fun, a bold, broad brow, and
      thick, light curls. There was a spring and vigour as of perpetual
      irrepressible life about the whole being, and the moment he had accepted
      his uncle&rsquo;s kiss, he poised his lance, and exclaimed, &lsquo;You are Bonaparte,
      I&rsquo;m the Duke!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed,&rsquo; said Mr. Ferrars, at once seizing a wand, and bestriding the
      nearest bench. Two or three charges rendered the boy so uproarious, that
      presently he was ordered off, and to use the old apple tree as Bonaparte.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a stout fellow!&rsquo; said Mr. Ferrars, as he went off at a plunging
      gallop, &lsquo;I should have taken him for at least five years old!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So he might be,&rsquo; said Albinia, &lsquo;for strength and spirit&mdash;he is
      utterly fearless, and never cries, much as he knocks himself about! He
      will do anything but learn. The rogue! he once knew all his letters, but
      no sooner did he find they were the work of life, than he forgot every
      one, and was never so obstreperous as when called upon to say them. I gave
      up the point, but I foresee some fine scenes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;His minding no one but you is an old story. I hope at least the exception
      continues.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have avoided testing it. I want all my forces for a decisive battle. I
      never heard of such a masterful imp,&rsquo; she continued, with much more
      exultation than anxiety, &lsquo;his sisters have no chance with him, he rules
      them like a young Turk. There&rsquo;s the pony! Sophy will let him have it as a
      right, and it is the work of my life to see that she is not defrauded of
      her rides.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t mean that that child rides anything but a stick.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One would think he had been born in boots and spurs. Legitimately he only
      rides with some one leading the pony, but I have my suspicions that by
      some preternatural means he has been on the pony&rsquo;s back, and round the
      yard alone, and that papa prudentially concealed it from me!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I confess I should not like it,&rsquo; said her brother gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! I don&rsquo;t mind that kind of thing. A real boy can&rsquo;t be hurt, and I
      don&rsquo;t care how wild he runs, so long as he is obedient and truthful. And
      true I think he is to the backbone, and I know he is reverend. We had such
      a disturbance because he would not say his prayers.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Proof positive!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, it was,&rsquo; said Albinia. &lsquo;It did not seem to him orthodox without me,
      and when he was let into my room again, it was the prettiest sight! When
      he had been told of his little sister, all he said was that he did not
      want little girls&mdash;girls were stupid&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! that came of your premature introduction to my Albinia,&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not at all. It was partly as William&rsquo;s own nephew, and partly because
      pleasure was expected from him. But when he actually saw the little thing,
      that sturdy face grew so very soft and sweet, and when we told him he was
      her protector, he put both his hands tight together, and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be so
      good!&rdquo; When he is with her, another child seems to shine out under the
      bluff pickle he generally is&mdash;he walks so quietly, and thinks it such
      an honour to touch her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She will be his best tutor,&rsquo; said Maurice, smiling, but breaking off&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      A sudden shriek of deadly terror rang out over the garden from the river!
      A second or two sufficed to show them Lucy at the other end of the
      foot-bridge, that led across the canal to the towing-path. She did not
      look round, till Albinia, clutching her, demanded, &lsquo;Where is he?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Unable to speak, Lucy pointed down the towing-path, along which a horse
      was seen rushing wildly&mdash;a figure pursuing it. &lsquo;It was hitched up
      here&mdash;he must have scrambled up by the gate! Oh! mamma! mamma! He has
      run after him, but oh!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ferrars gave Lucy&rsquo;s arm a squeeze, a hint not to augment the horror.
      Something he said of &lsquo;Let me&mdash;and you had better&mdash;&rsquo; but Albinia
      heard nothing, and was only bent on pressing forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      The canal and path took a wide sweep round the meadow, and the horse was
      still in sight, galloping at full speed, with a small heap on its back, as
      they trusted, but the rapid motion, and their eyes strained and misty with
      alarm, caused an agony of uncertainty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia pointed across the meadows in anguish at not being able to make
      herself understood, and hoarsely said, &lsquo;The gate!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ferrars caught her meaning, and the next moment had leaped over the
      gutter, and splashed into the water meadow, but in utter hopelessness of
      being beforehand with the runaway steed! How could that gate be other than
      fatal? The horse was nearing it&mdash;the pursuer far behind&mdash;Mr.
      Ferrars not half way over the fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a loud cry from Lucy.&mdash;&lsquo;He is caught! caught!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A loud shout came back, was caught up, and sent on by both the pursuers,
      &lsquo;All right!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia had stood in an almost annihilation of conscious feeling. Even
      when her brother strode back to her repeating &lsquo;All safe, thanks be to
      God,&rsquo; she neither spoke nor relaxed that intensity of watching. A few
      seconds more, and she sprang forward again as the horse was led up by a
      young man at his side; and on his back, laughing and chattering, sat
      Master Maurice. Algernon Dusautoy strode a few steps behind, somewhat
      aggrieved, but that no one saw.
    </p>
    <p>
      The elder Maurice lifted down the younger one, who, as he was clasped by
      his mother, exclaimed, &lsquo;Oh! mamma, Bamfylde went so fast! I am to ride
      home again! He said so&mdash;he&rsquo;s my cousin!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia scarcely heard; her brother however had turned to thank the
      stranger for her, and exclaimed, &lsquo;I should say you were an O&rsquo;More.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m Ulick, from the Loughside Lodge,&rsquo; was the answer. &lsquo;Is cousin Winifred
      here?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, this is my sister, Mrs. Kendal, but&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia held out her hand, and grasped his; &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t&mdash;Maurice,
      speak,&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little Maurice persisted in his demand to be remounted for the twelve
      yards to their own gate, but nobody heard him; his uncle was saying a few
      words of explanation to the stranger, and Algernon Dusautoy was
      enunciating something intended as a gracious reception of the apologies
      which no one was making. All Albinia thought of was that the little unruly
      hand was warm and struggling, prisoned in her own; all her brother cared
      for was to have her safely at home. He led her across the bridge, and into
      the garden, where they met Mr. Kendal, who had taken alarm from her
      absence; Lucy ran up with her story, and almost at the same moment,
      Albinia, springing to him, murmured, &lsquo;Oh! Edmund, the great mercy&mdash;Maurice;&rsquo; 
      but there she found herself making a hoarse shriek; with a mingled sense
      of fright and shame, she smothered it, but there was an agony of
      suffocation, she felt her husband&rsquo;s arms round her, heard his voice, and
      her boy&rsquo;s scream of terror&mdash;felt them all unable to help her, and
      sank into unconsciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ferrars helped Mr. Kendal to carry his wife&rsquo;s inanimate form to her
      room. They used all means of restoration, but it was a long, heavy swoon,
      and a slow, painful revival. Mr. Kendal would have been in utter despair
      at hearing that the doctor was out, but for his brother, with his ready
      resources and cheerful encouragement; and finally, she lifted her eyelids,
      and as she felt the presence of her two dearest guardians, whispered,
      &lsquo;Where is he?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy reported that he was with Susan, and Albinia, after hearing her
      husband again assure her that he was quite safe, lay still from
      exhaustion, but so calm, that her brother thought them best alone, and
      drew Lucy away.
    </p>
    <p>
      In about a quarter of an hour Mr. Kendal came down, saying that she was
      quietly asleep, and he had left the nurse with her. He had yet to hear the
      story, and when he understood that the child had been madly careering
      along the towing-path, on the back of young Dusautoy&rsquo;s most spirited
      hunter, and had been only stopped when the horse was just about to leap
      the tall gate, he was completely overcome. When he spoke again, it was
      with the abrupt exclamation, &lsquo;That child! Lucy, bring him down!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In marched the boy, full of life and mischief, though with a large red
      spot beneath each eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Maurice!&rsquo; Gilbert had often heard that tone, but Maurice never, and he
      tossed back his head with an innocent look of fearless wonder. &lsquo;Maurice, I
      find you have been a very naughty, disobedient boy. When you rode the pony
      round the yard, did not I order you never to do so again?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I did not do it again,&rsquo; boldly rejoined Maurice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Speak the truth, sir. What do you mean by denying what you have done?&rsquo; 
      exclaimed his father, angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t ride the pony,&rsquo; indignantly cried the child, &lsquo;I rode a horse,
      saddled and bridled!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t answer me in that way!&rsquo; thundered Mr. Kendal, and much incensed by
      the nice distinction, and not appreciating the sincerity of it, he gave
      the child a shake, rough enough to bring the red into his face, but not a
      tear. &lsquo;You knew it was very wrong, and you were as near as possible
      breaking your neck. You have frightened your mamma, so as to make her very
      ill, and I am sorry to find you most mischievous and unruly, not to be
      trusted out of sight. Now, listen to me, I shall punish you very severely
      if you act in this disobedient way again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Papa angry, was a novel spectacle, at which Maurice looked as innocently
      and steadily as ever, so completely without fear or contrition, that he
      provoked a stern, &lsquo;Do you hear me, sir?&rsquo; and another shake. Maurice
      flushed, and his chest heaved, though he did not sob, and his father,
      uncomfortable at such sharp dealing with so young a child, set him aside,
      with the words, &lsquo;There now, recollect what I have told you!&rsquo; and walked to
      the window, where he stood silent for some seconds, while the boy stood
      with rounded shoulders, perplexed eye, and finger on his pouting lip, and
      Mr. Ferrars, newspaper in hand, watched him under his eyelids, and
      speculated what would be the best sort of mediation, or whether the young
      gentleman yet deserved it. He knew that his own Willie would have been a
      mere quaking, sobbing mass of terror, under such a shake, and he would
      like to have been sure whether that sturdy silence were obstinacy or
      fortitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sound of the door-bell made Mr. Kendal turn round, and laying his hand
      on the little fellow&rsquo;s fair head, he said, &lsquo;There, Maurice, we&rsquo;ll say no
      more about it if you will be a good boy. Run away now, but don&rsquo;t go into
      your mamma&rsquo;s room.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Maurice looked up, tossed his curls out of his eyes, shook himself, felt
      the place on his arm where the grip of the hand had been, and galloped off
      like the young colt that he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia awoke, refreshed, though still shaken and feeble, and surprised to
      find that dinner was going on downstairs. Her own meal presently put such
      new force into her, that she felt able to speak Maurice&rsquo;s name without
      bursting into tears, and longing to see both her little ones beside her,
      she told the nurse to fetch the boy, but received for answer, &lsquo;No, Master
      Maurice said he would not come,&rsquo; and the manner conveyed that it had been
      defiantly said. Master Maurice was no favourite in the nursery, and he was
      still less so, when his mamma, disregarding all mandates, set out to seek
      him. Already she heard from the stairs the wrangling with Susan that
      accompanied all his toilettes, and she found him the picture of firm,
      solid fairness, in his little robe de nuit, growling through the combing
      of his tangled locks. Though ordinarily scornful of caresses, he sprang to
      her and hugged her, as she sat down on a low chair, and he knelt in her
      lap, whispering with his head on her shoulder, and his arms round her
      neck, &lsquo;Mamma, were you dead?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, Maurice,&rsquo; she answered with something of a sob, &lsquo;or I should not have
      my dear, dear little boy throttling me now! But why would you not come
      down to me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Papa said I must not.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, that was quite right, my boy;&rsquo; and though she unclasped the tight
      arms, she drew him nestling into her bosom. &lsquo;Oh, Maurice, it has been a
      terrible day! Does my little boy know how good the great God has been to
      him, and how near he was never seeing mamma nor his little sister again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her great object was to make him thankful for his preservation, but with a
      child, knowing nothing of death and heedless of fear, this was very
      difficult. The rapid motion had been delightful excitement, or if there
      had been any alarm, it was forgotten in the triumph. She had to change her
      note, and represent how the poor horse might have run into the river, or
      against a post! Maurice looked serious, and then she came to the high
      moral tone&mdash;mounting strangers&rsquo; horses without leave&mdash;would
      papa, would Gilbert, think of such a thing? The full lip was put out, as
      though under conviction, and he hung his head. &lsquo;You wont do it again?&rsquo; 
      said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She told him to say his prayers, guiding the confession and thanksgiving
      that she feared he did not fully follow. As he rose up, and saw the tears
      on her cheeks, he whispered, &lsquo;Mamma, did it make you <i>so</i>?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cause and effect were a great puzzle to him, but that swoon was the only
      thing that brought home to him that he had been guilty of something
      enormous, and when she owned that his danger had been the occasion, he
      stood and looked; then, standing bolt upright, with clasped hands, and
      rosy feet pressed close together, he said, with a long breath, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll never
      get on Bamfylde again till I&rsquo;m a big boy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, Mr. Kendal pushed open the half-closed door, and Albinia,
      looking up, said, &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s a boy who knows he has done wrong, papa.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Never was more welcome excuse for lifting the gallant child to his breast,
      and lavishing caresses that would have been tender but for the strong
      spirit of riot which turned them into a game at romps, cut short by Mr.
      Kendal, as soon as the noise grew very outrageous. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s enough
      to-night; good night.&rsquo; And when they each had kissed the monkey face
      tossing about among the clothes, Maurice might have heard more pride than
      pain in the &lsquo;I never saw such a boy!&rsquo; with which they shut the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is not prudent!&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you think I could have rested till I had seen him? and he said you had
      told him not to come down.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I would have brought him to you. You are looking very ill; you had better
      go to bed at once.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I should not sleep. Pray let me grow quiet first. Now you know you
      trust Maurice,&mdash;old Maurice, and I&rsquo;ll lie on the sofa like any mouse,
      if you&rsquo;ll bring him up and let him talk. You know it will be an
      interesting novelty for you to talk, and me to listen! and he has not seen
      the baby.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia gained her point, but Mr. Kendal and Lucy first tucked her up upon
      the sofa, till she cried out, &lsquo;You have swathed me hand and foot. How am I
      to show off that little Awk?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll take care of that,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal; and so he did, fully doing the
      honours of the little daughter, who had already fastened on his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But,&rsquo; cried Albinia, breaking into the midst, &lsquo;who or what are we,
      ungrateful monsters, never to have thought of the man who caught that
      dreadful horse!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You shall see him as soon as you are strong enough,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal;
      &lsquo;your brother and I have been with him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I am glad; I could not rest if he had not been thanked. And can
      anything be done for him? What is he? I thought he was a gentleman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Maurice smiled, and Mr. Kendal answered, &lsquo;Yes, he is Mr. Goldsmith&rsquo;s
      nephew, and I am pleased to find that he is a connexion of your brother.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One of the O&rsquo;Mores,&rsquo; cried Albinia. &lsquo;Oh, Maurice, is it really one of
      Winifred&rsquo;s O&rsquo;Mores?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Even so,&rsquo; replied Mr. Ferrars; the very last person I should have
      expected to meet on the banks of the Baye! It was that clever son of the
      captain&rsquo;s for whose education Mr. Goldsmith paid, and it seems had sent
      for, to consider of his future destination. He only arrived yesterday.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A very fine young man,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal. &lsquo;I was particularly pleased with
      his manner, and it was an act of great presence of mind and dexterity.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is all a maze and mystery to me,&rsquo; said Albinia; &lsquo;do tell me all about
      it. I can&rsquo;t make out how the horse came there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I understood that young Dusautoy was calling here,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal; &lsquo;I
      wondered at even his coolness in coming in by that way, and at your
      letting him in.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I saw nothing of him,&rsquo; said Albinia. &lsquo;Perhaps he was looking for
      Gilbert.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Lucy, looking up from her work, with a slight blush, and demure
      voice of secret importance; &lsquo;he had only stepped in for a minute, to bring
      me a new fern.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed,&rsquo; said her father; &lsquo;I was not aware that he took interest in your
      fernery.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He knows everything about ferns,&rsquo; said Lucy. &lsquo;Mrs. Cavendish Dusautoy
      once had a conservatory filled with the rarest specimens, and he has given
      me a great many directions how to manage them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! if he could get you to listen to his maxims, I don&rsquo;t wonder at
      anything,&rsquo; exclaimed Albinia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He had only just come in with the Adiantium, and was telling me how
      hydraulic power directed a stream of water near the roots among his
      mother&rsquo;s Fuci,&rsquo; said Lucy, rather hurt. &lsquo;He had fastened up his horse
      quite securely, and nobody could have guessed that Maurice could have
      opened that gate to cross the bridge, far less have climbed up the rail to
      the horse&rsquo;s back. I never shall forget my fright, when we heard the
      creature&rsquo;s feet, and Mr. Cavendish Dusautoy began to run after it
      directly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As foolish a thing as he could have done,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal, not impressed
      with Mr. Cavendish Dusautoy&rsquo;s condescension in giving chase. &lsquo;It was well
      poor little Maurice was not abandoned to your discretion, and his
      resources.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It seems,&rsquo; continued Mr. Ferrars, &lsquo;that young O&rsquo;More was taking a walk on
      the towing-path, and was just so far off as to see, without being able to
      prevent it, this little monkey scramble from the gate upon the horse&rsquo;s
      neck. How it was that he did not go down between, I can&rsquo;t guess; the beast
      gave a violent start, as well it might, jerked the reins loose, and set
      off full gallop. Seeing the child clinging on like a young panther, he
      dashed across the meadow, to cut him off at the turn of the river; and it
      was a great feat of swiftness, I assure you, to run so lightly through
      those marshy meadows, so as to get the start of the runaway; then he crept
      up under cover of the hedge, so as not to startle the horse, and had hold
      of the bridle, just as he paused before leaping the gate! He said he could
      hardly believe his eyes when he saw the urchin safe, and looking more
      excited than terrified.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, he was exceedingly struck with Maurice&rsquo;s spirit,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal,
      who, when the fright and anger were over, could begin to be proud of the
      exploit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They fraternized at once,&rsquo; said Mr. Ferrars. &lsquo;Maurice imparted that his
      name was Maurice Ferrars Kendal, and Ulick, in all good faith and Irish
      simplicity, discovered that they were cousins!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! Edmund, he must come to the christening dinner!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mind,&rsquo; said Maurice, &lsquo;you, know he is not even my wife&rsquo;s cousin; only
      nephew to her second cousin&rsquo;s husband.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For shame, Maurice, cousin is that cousinly does!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well, only don&rsquo;t tell the aunts that Winifred saddled all the
      O&rsquo;Mores upon you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not an O&rsquo;More but should be welcome for his sake!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nor an Irishman,&rsquo; said Mr. Ferrars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia suffered so much from the shock, that she could not make her
      appearance till noon on the following day. Then, after sitting a little
      while in the old study, to hear that grandmamma had not been able to sleep
      all night for thinking of Maurice&rsquo;s danger, and being told some terrible
      stories of accidents with horses, she felt one duty done, and moved on to
      the drawing-room in search of her brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      She found herself breaking upon a tete-a-tete. A sweet, full voice, with
      strong cadences, was saying something about duty and advice, and she would
      have retreated, but her brother and the stranger both sprang up, and made
      her understand that she was by no means to go away. No introduction was
      wanted; she grasped the hand that was extended to her, and would have said
      something if she could, but she found herself not strong enough to keep
      from tears, and only said, &lsquo;I wish little Maurice were not gone out with
      his brother, but you will dine with us, and see him to-morrow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With the greatest pleasure, if my uncle and aunt will spare me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They must,&rsquo; said Albinia, &lsquo;you must come to meet your old friend and <i>cousin</i>,&rsquo; 
      she added, mischievously glancing at Maurice, but he did not look inclined
      to disavow the relationship, and the youth was not a person whom any one
      would wish to keep at a distance. He seemed about nineteen or twenty years
      of age, not tall, but well made, and with an air of great ease and
      agility, rather lounging and careless, yet alert in a moment. The cast of
      his features at once betrayed his country, by the rounded temples, with
      the free wavy hair; the circular form of the eyebrow; the fully opened
      dark blue eye, looking almost black when shaded; the short nose, and the
      well-cut chin and lips, with their outlines of sweetness and of fun, all
      thoroughly Irish, but of the best style, and with a good deal of thought
      and mind on the brow, and determination in the mouth. Albinia had scarcely
      a minute, however, for observation, for he seemed agitated, and in haste
      to take leave, nor did her brother press him to remain, since she was
      still looking very white and red, and too fragile for anything but rest.
      With another squeeze of the hand she let him go, while he, with murmured
      thanks, and head bent in enthusiastic honour to the warm kindness of one
      so sweet and graceful, took leave. Mr. Ferrars followed him into the hall,
      leaving the door open, so that she heard the words, &lsquo;Good-bye, Ulick; I&rsquo;ll
      do my best for you. All I can say is, that I respect you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t respect me too soon,&rsquo; he answered; &lsquo;maybe you&rsquo;ll have to change
      your mind. The situation may like me no better than I the situation.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, what you will, you can do; I trust to your perseverance.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As my poor mother does! Well, with patience the snail got to Rome, and if
      it is to lighten her load, I must bear it. Many thanks, Mr. Ferrars. Good
      morning.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good morning; only, Ulick, excuse me, but let me give you a hint; if the
      situation is to like you, you must mind your Irish.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you must not warm my heart with your kindness,&rsquo; was the answer. &lsquo;No,
      no, never fear, when I&rsquo;m not with any one who has seen Ballymakilty, I can
      speak English so that I could not be known for a Galway man. Not that I&rsquo;m
      ashamed of my country,&rsquo; he added; and the next moment the door shut behind
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How could you scold him for his Irish?&rsquo; exclaimed Albinia, as her brother
      re-entered; &lsquo;it sounds so pretty and characteristic.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I fear Mr. Goldsmith may think it too characteristic!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am sure Edmund might well call him prepossessing. I hope Mr. Goldsmith
      is going to do something handsome for him!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor lad! Mr. Goldsmith considers that he has purchased him for a
      permanent fixture on a high stool. It is a sad disappointment, for he had
      been doing his utmost to prepare himself for college, and he has so far
      distinguished himself at school, that I see that a very little help would
      soon enable him to maintain himself at the University. I could have found
      it in my heart to give it to him myself; it would please Winifred.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, let us help; I am sure Edmund would be glad.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no, this is better for all. Remember this is the Goldsmith&rsquo;s only
      measure of conciliation towards their sister since her marriage, and it
      ought not to be interfered with. Poor Ulick says he knows this is the
      readiest chance of being of any use to his family, and that his mother has
      often said she should be happy if she could but see one of the six
      launched in a way to be independent! There are those three eldest, little
      better than squireens, never doing a thing but loafing about with their
      guns. I used to long for a horse-whip to lay about them, till they spoke
      to me, and then not one of the rogues but won my heart with his fun and
      good-nature.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then I suppose it is a great thing to have one in the way of
      money-making.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hem! The Celtic blood is all in commotion! This boy&rsquo;s business was to ask
      my candid opinion whether there were anything ungentlemanlike in a
      clerkship in a bank. It was well it was not you!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, Maurice, don&rsquo;t you know how glad I should have been if Gilbert would
      have been as wise!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, you have some common sense after all, which is more than Ulick
      attributes to his kith and kin. When I had proved the respectability of
      banking to his conviction, I&rsquo;ll not say satisfaction, he made me promise
      to write to his father. He is making up his mind to what is not only a
      great vexation to himself, and very irksome employment, but he knows he
      shall be looked down upon as having lost caste with all his family!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It really is heroism!&rsquo; cried Albinia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is,&rsquo; said Mr. Ferrars; &lsquo;he does not trust himself to face the clan,
      and means to get into harness at once, so as to clench his resolution, and
      relieve his parents from his maintenance immediately.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is he to live with that formal Miss Goldsmith?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No. In solitary lodgings, after that noisy family and easy home! I can&rsquo;t
      think how he will stand it. I should not wonder if the Galwegian was too
      strong after all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We must do all we can for him,&rsquo; cried Albinia; &lsquo;Edmund likes him already.
      Can&rsquo;t he dine with us every Sunday?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know you will be kind,&rsquo; said Mr. Ferrars. &lsquo;Only see how things turn out
      before you commit yourself. Ah! I have said the unlucky word which always
      makes you fly off!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was little fear that Ulick O&rsquo;More would not win his way with Mr. and
      Mrs. Kendal, recommended as he was, and with considerable attractions in
      the frankness and brightness of his manner. He was a very pleasant
      addition to the party who dined at Willow Lawn, after the christening. No
      one had time to listen to Mr. Cavendish Dusautoy&rsquo;s maxims, and he retired
      rather sullenly, to lean against the mantelpiece, and marvel why the
      Kendals should invite an Irish banker&rsquo;s clerk to meet <i>him</i>. Gilbert
      likewise commented on the guest with a muttered observation on his
      sisters&rsquo; taste; &lsquo;Last year it was all the Polysyllable, now it would be
      all the Irishman!&rsquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      There was a war of supremacy in the Kendal household. Albinia and her son
      were Greek to Greek, and if physical force were on her side, her own
      tenderness was against her. As to allies, Maurice had by far the majority
      of the household; the much-tormented Susan was her mistress&rsquo;s sole
      supporter; Mr. Kendal and Sophy might own it inexpedient to foster his
      outrecuidance, but they so loved to do his bidding, so hated to thwart
      him, and so grieved at his being punished, that they were little better
      than Gilbert, Lucy, grandmamma, or any of the maids or men.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moral sense was not yet stirred, and the boy seemed to be trying the
      force of his will like the strength of his limbs. Even as he delighted to
      lift a weight the moment he saw that it was heavy, so a command was to him
      a challenge to see how much he would undergo rather than obey, but his
      resistance was so open, gay, and free, that it could hardly be called
      obstinacy, and he gloried in disappointing punishment. The dark closet
      lost all terror for him; he stood there blowing the horn through his hand,
      content to follow an imaginary chase, and when untimely sent to bed, he
      stole Susan&rsquo;s scissors, and cut a range of stables in the sheets. The
      short, sharp infliction of pain answered best, but his father, though he
      could give a shake when angry, could <i>not</i> strike when cool, and
      Albinia was forced to turn executioner, though with such tears and
      trembling that her culprit looked up reassuringly, saying, &lsquo;Never mind,
      mamma, I shan&rsquo;t!&rsquo; He did, however, <i>mind</i> her tears, they bore in
      upon him the sense of guilt; and after each transgression, he could not be
      at peace till he had marched up to her, holding out his hand for the blow,
      and making up his face not to wince, and then would cling round her neck
      to feel himself pardoned. Justice came to him in a most fair and motherly
      shape! The brightest, the merriest of all his playmates was mamma; he
      loved her passionately, and could endure no cloud between himself and her,
      so that he was slowly learning that submission to her was peace and
      pleasure, and rebellion mere pain to both. She established ten minutes of
      daily lessons, but even she could not reach beyond the capture of his
      restless person, his mind was out of reach, and keen as he was in
      everything else, towards &ldquo;a + b = ab&rdquo; he was an unmitigated dunce. Nor did
      he obey any one who did not use authority and force of will, and though
      perfectly simple and sincere, he was too young to restrain himself without
      the assistance of the controlling power, so that in his mother&rsquo;s absence
      he was tyrannical and violent, and she never liked to have him out of her
      sight, and never was so sure that he was deep in mischief as when she had
      not heard his voice for a quarter of an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Albinia,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal, one relenting autumn day, when November strove
      to look like April, &lsquo;I thought of walking to pay Farmer Graves for the
      corn. Will you come with me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Delightful, I want to see what Maurice will say to the turkey-cock.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it not too far for him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He would run quite as many miles in the garden,&rsquo; said Albinia, who would
      have walked in dread of a court of justice on her return, had not the
      scarlet hose been safely prancing on the road before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This way, then,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal; &lsquo;I must get this draft changed at the
      bank. Come, Maurice, you will see a friend there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you know, Edmund,&rsquo; said Albinia, as they set forth, &lsquo;my conscience
      smites me as to that youth; I think we have neglected him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I cannot see what more we could have done. If his uncle does not bring
      him forward in society, we cannot interfere.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It must be a forlorn condition,&rsquo; said Albinia; &lsquo;he is above the other
      clerks, and he seems to be voted below the Bayford Elite, since the
      Polysyllable has made it so very refined! One never meets him anywhere now
      it is too dark to walk after the banking hours. Cannot we ask him to come
      in some evening?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We cannot have our evenings broken up,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal. &lsquo;I should be
      glad to show him any kindness, but his uncle seems to have ruled it that
      he is to be considered more as his clerk than as one of his family, and I
      doubt if it would be doing him any service to interfere.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They were now at the respectable old freestone building, with &lsquo;Goldsmith&rsquo; 
      inscribed on the iron window-blinds, and a venerable date carved over the
      door. Inside, those blinds came high, and let in but little light over the
      tall desks, at which were placed the black-horsehair perches of the
      clerks, old Mr. Goldsmith himself occupying a lower throne, more
      accessible to the clients. One of the high stools stood empty, and Albinia
      making inquiry, Mr. Goldsmith answered, with a dry, dissatisfied cough,
      that More, as he called him, had struck work, and gone home with a
      headache.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed,&rsquo; said Albinia, &lsquo;I am sorry to hear it. Mr. Hope said he thought
      him not looking well.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He has complained of headache a good deal lately,&rsquo; said Mr. Goldsmith.
      &lsquo;Young men don&rsquo;t find it easy to settle to business.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia&rsquo;s heart smote her for not having thought more of her son&rsquo;s
      rescuer, and she revolved what could or what might have been done. It
      really was not easy to show him attention, considering Gilbert&rsquo;s prejudice
      against his accent, and Mr. Kendal&rsquo;s dislike to an interrupted evening,
      and all she could devise was a future call on Miss Goldsmith. But for
      Maurice, it would have been a silent walk, and though her mind was a
      little diverted by his gallant attempt to bestride the largest pig in the
      farm-yard, she was sure Mr. Kendal was musing on the same topic, and was
      not surprised when, as they returned, he exclaimed, &lsquo;I have a great mind
      to go and see after that poor lad.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This way, then,&rsquo; said Albinia, turning down a narrow muddy street
      parallel with the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Impossible!&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal; &lsquo;he can never live at the Wharves?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Albinia; &lsquo;he told me that he lodged with an old servant of the
      Goldsmiths, Pratt&rsquo;s wife, at the Lower Wharf.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She pointed to the name of Pratt over a shop-window in a house that had
      once seen better days, but which looked so forlorn, that Mr. Kendal would
      not look the slatternly maid in the face while so absurd a question was
      asked as whether Mr. O&rsquo;More lived there.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl, without further ceremony, took them up a dark stair, and opened
      the door of a twilight room, where Albinia&rsquo;s first glimpse showed her the
      young man with his head bent down on his arms on the table, as close as
      possible to the forlorn, black fire, of the grim, dull, sulky coal of the
      county, which had filled the room with smoke and blacks. The window,
      opened to clear it, only admitted the sickly scent of decaying weed from
      the river to compete with the perfume of the cobbler&rsquo;s stock-in-trade.
      Ulick started up pale and astonished, and Mr. Kendal, struck with
      consternation, chiefly thought of taking away his wife and child from the
      infected atmosphere, and made signs to Albinia not to sit down; but she
      was eagerly compassionate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was nothing,&rsquo; said Ulick, &lsquo;only his head was rather worse than usual,
      and he thought it time to give in when the threes put lapwings&rsquo; feathers
      in their caps just like the fives.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you subject to these headaches?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is only home-sickness,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll have got over it soon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I must come and see after you, my good friend,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal, with
      suppressed impatience and anxiety. &lsquo;I shall return in a moment or two, but
      I am sure you are not well enough for so many visitors taking you by
      surprise. Come.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He was so peremptory, that Albinia found herself on the staircase before
      she knew what she was about. The fever panic had seized Mr. Kendal in full
      force; he believed typhus was in the air, and insisted on her taking
      Maurice home at once, while he went himself to fetch Mr. Bowles. She did
      not in the least credit fever to be in the chill touch of that lizard
      hand, and believed that she could have been the best doctor; but there was
      no arguing while he was under this alarm, and she knew that she might be
      thankful not to be ordered to observe a quarantine.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mr. Kendal returned home he looked much discomposed, though his first
      words were, &lsquo;Thank Heaven, it is no fever! Albinia, we must look after
      that poor lad; he is positively poisoned by that pestiferous river and bad
      living! Bowles said he was sure he was not eating meat enough. I dare say
      that greasy woman gives him nothing fit to eat! Albinia, you must talk to
      him&mdash;find out whether old Goldsmith gives him a decent salary!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He ought not to be in those lodgings another day. I suppose Miss
      Goldsmith had no notion what they were. I fancy she never saw the Lower
      Wharf in her life.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never did till to-day,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal. &lsquo;It was all of a piece&mdash;the
      whole street&mdash;the room&mdash;the furniture&mdash;why the paper was
      coming off the walls! What could they be dreaming of! And there he was,
      trying to read a little edition of Prodentius, printed at Salamanca, which
      he picked up at a bookstall at Galway. It must have belonged to some
      priest educated in Spain. He says any Latin book was invaluable to him. He
      is infinitely too good for his situation, and the Goldsmiths are
      neglecting him infamously. Look out some rooms fit for him, Albinia.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will try. Let me see&mdash;if I could only recollect any; but Mr. Hope
      has the only really nice ones in the place.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Somewhere he must be, if it is in this house.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is poor old Madame Belmarche&rsquo;s still empty, with Bridget keeping
      it. I wish he could have rooms there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, why not? Pettilove told me it must be let as two tenements. If the
      old woman could take half, a lodger would pay her rent,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal,
      promptly. &lsquo;You had better propose it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And the Goldsmiths?&rsquo; asked Albinia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will show him the Lower Wharf.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The next afternoon Mr. Kendal desired his wife to go to the Bank and
      borrow young O&rsquo;More for her walking companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Really I don&rsquo;t know whether I have the impudence.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will come and do it for you. You will do best alone with the lad; I
      want you to get into his confidence, and find out whether old Goldsmith
      treats him properly. I declare, but that I know John Kendal so well, this
      would be enough to make me rejoice that Gilbert is not thrown on the
      world!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia knew herself to be so tactless, that she saw little hope other
      doing anything but setting him against his relations; but her husband was
      in no frame to hear objections, so she made none, and only trusted she
      should not be very foolish. At least, the walk would be a positive
      physical benefit to the slave of the desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ulick O&rsquo;More was at his post, and said his head was well, but his hair
      stuck up as if his fingers had been many times run through it; he was much
      thinner, and the wearied countenance, whitened complexion, and spiritless
      sunken eyes, were a sad contrast to the glowing freshness and life that
      had distinguished him in the summer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kendal told the Banker that it had been decided that his nephew needed
      exercise, and that Mrs. Kendal would be glad of his company in a long
      walk. Mr. Goldsmith seemed rather surprised, but consented, whereupon the
      young clerk lighted up into animation, and bounded out of his prison
      house, with a springy step learnt upon mountain heather. Mr. Kendal only
      waited to hear whither they were bound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! as far as we can go on the Woodside road,&rsquo; said Albinia. &lsquo;I think the
      prescription I used to inflict on poor Sophy will not be thrown away here.
      I always fancy there is a whiff of sea air upon the hill there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Ulick smiled at such a fond delusion, bred up as he had been upon the
      wildest sea-coast, exposed to the full sweep of the Atlantic storm! She
      set him off upon his own scenery, to the destruction of his laborious
      English, as he dwelt on the glories of his beloved rocks rent by fierce
      sea winds and waves into fantastic, grotesque, or lovely shapes, with
      fiords of exquisite blue sea between, the variety of which had been to him
      as the gentle foliage of tamer countries. Not a tree stood near the &lsquo;town&rsquo; 
      of Ballymakilty, but the wild crags, the sparkling waters, the broad open
      hills, and the bogs, with their intensely purple horizon, held fast upon
      his heart; and he told of white sands, reported to be haunted by mermaids,
      and crevices of rock where the tide roared, and gave rise to legends of
      sea monsters, and giants turned to stone. He was becoming confidential and
      intimate when, in a lowered voice, he mentioned the Banshee&rsquo;s crag, where
      the shrouded messenger of doom never failed to bewail each dying child of
      the O&rsquo;More, and where his own old nurse had actually beheld her keening
      for the uncle who was killed among the Caffres. Albinia began to know how
      she ought to respect the O&rsquo;Mores.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were skirting the side of the hill, with a dip of green meadow-land
      below them, rising on the other side into coppices. The twang of the horn,
      and the babbling cry of the hounds, reminded Albinia that the hunting
      season had begun, and looking over a gate, she watched the parti-coloured
      forms of the dogs glancing among the brushwood opposite, and an occasional
      red coat gleaming out through the hedge above. Just then the cry ceased,
      the dogs became silent, and scattered hither and thither bewildered. Ulick
      looked eagerly, then suddenly vaulted over the gate, went forward a few
      steps, looked again, pointed towards some dark object which she could
      barely discern, put his finger in his ear, and uttered an unearthly
      screech, incomprehensible to her, but well understood by the huntsman, and
      through him by the dogs, which at once simultaneously dashed in one
      direction, and came pouring into the meadow over towards him, down went
      their heads, up went their curved tails, the clatter and rushing of hoofs,
      and the apparition of red coats, showed the hunters all going round the
      copse, while at the same moment, away with winged steps bounded her
      companion, flying headlong like the wind, so as to meet the hunt.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &lsquo;Ask me not what the lady feels,
           Left in that dreadful hour alone,&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      laughed Albinia to herself. &lsquo;Well done, speed! Edmund might be satisfied
      there&rsquo;s not much amiss! Through the hedge&mdash;over the meadow&mdash;a
      flying leap over the stream&mdash;it is more like a bird than a man&mdash;up
      again. Does he mean to follow the hunt all the rest of the way? Rather
      Irish, I must say! And I do believe they will all come down this lane! I
      must walk on; it wont do to be overtaken here between these high hedges.
      Ah! I thought he was too much of a gentleman to leave me&mdash;here he
      comes. How much in his way I must be! I never saw such a runner; not a bit
      does he slacken for the hill&mdash;and what bright cheeks and eyes! What
      good it must have done him!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I beg ten thousand pardons!&rsquo; cried he, as he came up, scarcely out of
      breath. &lsquo;I declare I forgot you, I could not help it, when I saw them at a
      check!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You feel for the hunter as I do for the fox,&rsquo; said Albinia. &lsquo;Is yours one
      of the great hunting neighbourhoods?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That it is!&rsquo; he cried. &lsquo;My grandfather had the grand stud! He and his
      seven sons were out three times in the week, and there was a mount for
      whoever wanted it!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And this generation is not behind the last?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! and why would it be?&rsquo; exclaimed the boy, the last remnant of English
      pronunciation forsaking him. &lsquo;My Uncle Connel has the best mare on this
      side the bridge of Athlone! I mean that side.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And how is it with you?&rsquo; asked Albinia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We&rsquo;ve got no horses&mdash;that is, except my father&rsquo;s mare, and the colt,
      and Fir Darrig&mdash;the swish-tailed pony&mdash;and the blind donkey that
      brings in the turf. So we younger ones mostly go hunting on foot; and
      after all I believe that&rsquo;s the best sport. Bryan always comes in before
      any of the horses, and we all think it a shame if we don&rsquo;t!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I see where you learnt the swiftness of foot that was so useful last
      July,&rsquo; said Albinia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That? oh! but Bryan would have been up long before me,&rsquo; said Ulick. &lsquo;He&rsquo;d
      have made for the lock, not the gate! You should see what sport we have
      when the fox takes to the Corrig Dearg up among the rocks&mdash;and little
      Rosie upon Fir Darrig, with her hair upon the wind, and her colour like
      the morning cloud, glancing in and out among the rocks like the fairy of
      the glen. There are those that think her the best part of the hunt; they
      say the English officers at Ochlochtimore would never think it worth
      coming out but for her. I don&rsquo;t believe that, you know,&rsquo; he added,
      laughing, &lsquo;though I like to fetch a rise out of Ulick at the great house
      by telling him of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How old is she?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fifteen last April, and she is like an April wind, when it comes warm and
      frolicking over the sea! So wild and free, and yet so gentle and soft!
      Ellen and Mary are grave and steady, and work hard&mdash;every stitch of
      my stockings was poor Mary&rsquo;s knitting, except what poor old Peggy would
      send up for a compliment; but Rosie&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think she does a thing
      but sing, and ride, and row the boat, and keep the house alive! My mother
      shakes her head, but I don&rsquo;t know what she&rsquo;ll say when she gets my aunt&rsquo;s
      letter. My Aunt Goldsmith purses up her lips, and says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll write to
      advise my sister to send her daughters to some good school.&rdquo; Ellen, maybe,
      might bear one, but ah! the thought of little Rosie in a good school!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Like her brother Ulick in a good bank, eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why,&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;they always called me the steady Englishman!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia laughed, but at that moment the sounds of the hunt again occupied
      them, and all were interpreted by Ulick with the keenest interest, but he
      would not run away again, though she exhorted him not to regard her.
      Presently it swept on out of hearing, and by-and-bye they reached the
      summit of the hill, and looked forth on the dark pine plantations on the
      opposite undulation, standing out in black relief against a sky golden
      with a pale, pure, pearly November sunset, a &lsquo;daffodil sky&rsquo; flecked with
      tiny fleeces of soft bright-yellow light, reminding Albinia of Fouque&rsquo;s
      beautiful dream of Aslauga&rsquo;s golden hair showing the gates of Heaven to
      her devoted knight. She looked for her companion&rsquo;s sympathy in her
      admiration, but the woods seemed to oppress him, and his panting sigh
      showed how real a thing was <i>he-men</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! my poor sun!&rsquo; he broke out, &lsquo;I pity you for having to go down before
      your time into these black, stifling woods that rise up to smother you
      like giants&mdash;and not into your own broad, cool Atlantic, laughing up
      your own sparkles of light.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We inland people can hardly appreciate your longing for space.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a very prison,&rsquo; said Ulick; &lsquo;the horizon is choked all round, and
      one can&rsquo;t breathe in these staid stiff hedges and enclosures!&rsquo; And he
      threw out his arms and flapped them over his breast with a gesture of
      constraint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You seem no friend to cultivation.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, your meadows would be pretty things if they were a little greener,&rsquo; 
      said Ulick; &lsquo;but one gets tired of them, and of those straight lines of
      ploughed field. There&rsquo;s no sense of liberty; it is like the man whose
      prison walls closed in upon him!&rsquo; And he gave another weary sigh, his step
      lost elasticity, and he moved on heavily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are tired; I have brought you too far.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tired by a bit of a step like this?&rsquo; cried the boy, disdainfully, as he
      straightened himself, and resumed his brisk tread. But it did not last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I had forgotten that you had not been well,&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pshaw!&rsquo; muttered Ulick; then resumed, &lsquo;Aye, Mr. Kendal brought in the
      doctor upon me&mdash;very kind of him&mdash;but I do assure you &lsquo;tis
      nothing but home sickness; I was nearly as bad when I went to St. Columba,
      but I got over it then, and I will again!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It may be so in part,&rsquo; said Albinia, kindly; &lsquo;but let me be impertinent,
      Ulick, for my sister Winifred told me to look after you; surely you give
      it every provocation. Such a change of habits is enough to make any one
      ill. Should you not ask your uncle for a holiday, and go home for a little
      while?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t name it, I beg of you,&rsquo; cried the poor lad in an agitated voice,
      &lsquo;it would only bring it all over again! I&rsquo;ve promised my mother to do my
      part, and with His help I <i>will</i>! Let the columns run out to all
      eternity, and the figures crook themselves as spitefully as they will,
      I&rsquo;ve vowed to myself not to stir till I&rsquo;ve got the better of the
      villains!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said Albinia, &lsquo;they have blackened your eyes like the bruises of
      material antagonists! Yes, it is a gallant battle, but indeed you must
      give yourself all the help you can, for it would be doing your mother no
      good to fall ill.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve no fears,&rsquo; said Ulick; &lsquo;I know very well what is the matter with me,
      and that if I don&rsquo;t give way, it will go off in time. You&rsquo;ve given it a
      good shove with your kindness, Mrs. Kendal,&rsquo; he added, with deep emotion
      in his sensitive voice; &lsquo;only you must not talk of my going home, or
      you&rsquo;ll undo all you have done.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then I won&rsquo;t; we must try to make you a home here. And in the first
      place, those lodgings of yours; you can never be comfortable in them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! you saw my fire smoking. I never shall learn to make a coal fire
      burn.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not only that,&rsquo; said Albinia, &lsquo;but you might easily find rooms much
      better furnished, and fitter for you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do assure you,&rsquo; exclaimed Ulick, &lsquo;you scarcely saw it! Why, I don&rsquo;t
      think there&rsquo;s a room at the big house in better order, or so good!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At least,&rsquo; said Albinia, repressing her deduction as to the big house of
      Ballymakilty, &lsquo;you have no particular love for the locality&mdash;the
      river smell&mdash;the stock of good leather, &amp;c.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s all Bayford and town smell together,&rsquo; said Ulick; &lsquo;I never thought
      one part worse than another, begging your pardon, Mrs. Kendal.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I am sure,&rsquo; she continued, &lsquo;that woman can never make your meals
      comfortable. Yes, I see I am right, and I assure you hard head-work needs
      good living, and you will never be a match for the rogues in black and
      white without good beef-steaks. Now confess whether she gives you dinners
      of old shoe-leather.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A man can&rsquo;t sit down to dinner by himself,&rsquo; cried Ulick, impatiently.
      &lsquo;Tea with a book are all that is bearable.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you never go out&mdash;never see any one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I dine at my uncle&rsquo;s every Sunday,&rsquo; said Ulick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is that all the variety you have?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, my uncle told me he would not have me getting into what he calls
      idle company. I&rsquo;ve dined once at the vicarage, and drunk tea twice with
      Mr. Hope, but it is no use thinking of it&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t afford it, and
      that&rsquo;s the truth.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you any books? What can you find to do all the evening?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have a few that bear reading pretty often, and Mr. Hope as lent me
      some. I&rsquo;ve been trying to keep up my Greek, and then I do believe there&rsquo;s
      some way of simplifying those accounts by logarithms, if I could but work
      it out. But my mother told me to walk, and I assure you I do take a
      constitutional as soon as I come out at half-past four every day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I have designs, and mind you don&rsquo;t traverse them, or I shall have
      to report you at home. I have a lodging in my eye for you, away from the
      river, and a nice clean, tidy Irishwoman to keep you in order, make your
      fires, and cram you, if you wont eat, and see if she does not make a man
      of you&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stop, stop, Mrs. Kendal!&rsquo; cried Ulick, distressed. &lsquo;You are very kind,
      but it can&rsquo;t be.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Excuse me, it is economy of the wrong sort to live in a gutter, and catch
      agues and fevers. Only think, if it was my boy Gilbert, should I not be
      obliged to any one that would tyrannize over him for his good! Besides,
      what I propose is not at all beyond such means as Mr. Kendal tells me are
      the least Mr. Goldsmith ought to give you. Do you dislike going into
      particulars with me? You know I am used to think for Gilbert, and I am a
      sort of cousin.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are kindness itself,&rsquo; said Ulick; &lsquo;and there! I suppose I must go to
      the bottom of it, and it is no news that pence are not plenty among the
      O&rsquo;Mores, though it is no fault of my uncle. See there what my poor dear
      mother says.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew a letter from his pocket, and gave a page to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I miss you sorely, my boy,&rsquo; it said; &lsquo;I know the more what a support and
      friend you have been to me now that you are so far away; but all is made
      up to me in knowing you to be among my own people, and the instrument of
      reconciliation with my brother, as you well know how great has been the
      pain of the estrangement caused by my own pride and wilfulness. I cannot
      tell you how glad I am that he approves of you, and that you are beginning
      to get used to the work that was my own poor father&rsquo;s for so long. Bred up
      as you have been, my mountain lad, I scarcely dared to hope that you would
      be able to sit down quietly to it, with all our hopes of making you a
      scholar so suddenly frustrated; but I might have put faith in your loving
      heart and sense of duty to carry you through anything. I feel as if a load
      were off my mind since you and Bryan are so happily launched. The boy has
      not once applied for money since he joined; and if you write to him, pray
      beg him to be careful, for it would well-nigh drive your father mad to be
      pressed any more&mdash;the poor mare has been sold at a dead loss and the
      Carrick-humbug quarry company pays no dividends, so how we are to meet the
      Christmas bills I cannot guess. But, as you remember, we have won over
      worse times, and now Providence has been so good to you and Bryan, what
      have I to do but be thankful and hope the best.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Ulick watched her face, and gave her another note, saying mournfully, &lsquo;You
      see they all, but my mother, think, that if I am dragging our family
      honour through the mire, I&rsquo;ve got something by it. Poor Bryan, he knows no
      better&mdash;he&rsquo;s younger than me by two years.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The young ensign made a piteous confession of the first debt he had been
      able to contract, for twenty pounds, with a promise that if his brother
      would help him out of this one scrape, he would never run into another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am very sorry for you, Ulick,&rsquo; said Albinia, &lsquo;and I hate to advise you
      to be selfish, but it really is quite impossible for you to be paymaster
      for all your brothers&rsquo; debts.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If it were Connel, I know it would be of no use,&rsquo; said Ulick. &lsquo;But Bryan&mdash;you
      see he has got a start&mdash;they gave him a commission, and he is the
      finest fellow of us all, and knows what his word is, and keeps it! Maybe,
      if I get on, I may be able to save, and help him to his next step, and
      then if Redmond could get to college, my mother would be a happy woman,
      and all thanks to my uncle.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then it is this twenty pounds that is pinching you now? Is that it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You see my uncle said he would give me enough to keep me as a gentleman
      and his nephew, but not enough to keep all the family, as he said. After
      my Christmas quarter I shall be up in the world again, and then there will
      be time to think of the woman you spoke of&mdash;a Connaught woman, did
      you say?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      When Albinia reported this dialogue to her husband, he was much moved by
      this simple self-abnegation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is nothing for it,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;but to bring him here till Christmas,
      and by that time we will take care that the new lodgings are cheap enough
      for him. He must not be left to the mercy of old Goldsmith and his
      sister!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Even Albinia was astonished, but Mr. Kendal carried out his intentions,
      and went in quest of his new friend; while no one thought of objecting
      except grandmamma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose, my dear,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;that you know what Mr. Goldsmith means to
      do for this young man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am sure I don&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said Albinia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Really! Ah! well, I&rsquo;m an old woman, and I may be wrong, but my poor dear
      Mr. Meadows would never encourage a banker&rsquo;s clerk about the house unless
      he knew what were his expectations. Irish too! If there was a thing Mr.
      Meadows disliked more than another, it was an Irishman! He said they were
      all adventurers.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      However, Ulick&rsquo;s first evening at Willow Lawn was on what he called &lsquo;a
      headache day.&rsquo; He could not have taken a better measure for overcoming
      grandmamma&rsquo;s objections. Poor dear Mr. Meadows&rsquo; worldly wisdom was not
      sufficiently native to her to withstand the sight of anything so pale and
      suffering, especially as he did not rebel against answering her close
      examination, which concluded in her pronouncing these intermitting attacks
      to be agueish, and prescribing quinine. To take medicines is an effectual
      way of gaining an old lady&rsquo;s love. Ulick was soon established in her mind
      as &lsquo;a very pretty behaved young gentleman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evenings, when Mr. Kendal read aloud, Ulick listened, and enjoyed
      it from the corner where he sheltered his eyes from the light. He was told
      that he ought to go to bed quickly, but after the ladies were in their
      rooms, a long buzzing murmur was heard in the passage, and judicious
      peeping revealed the two gentlemen, each, candle in hand, the one with his
      back against the wall at the top of the stairs, the other leaning upon the
      balusters three steps below, and there they stayed, till the clock struck
      one, and Ulick&rsquo;s candle burnt out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What could you be talking about?&rsquo; asked the aggrieved Albinia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Prometheus Vinctus,&rsquo; composedly returned Mr. Kendal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ulick&rsquo;s eagerness in collecting every crumb of scholarship was a great
      bond of union; but there was still more in the bright, open, demonstrative
      nature of the youth, which had a great attraction for the reserved,
      serious Mr. Kendal, and scarcely a day had passed before they were on
      terms of intimacy, almost like an elder and younger brother. Admitted into
      the family as a connexion, Ulick at once viewed the girls as cousins, and
      treated them with the same easy grace of good-natured familiarity as if
      they had been any of the nineteen Miss O&rsquo;Mores around Ballymakilty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How is your head now?&rsquo; asked Mr. Kendal. &lsquo;You are late this evening.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Ulick, entering the drawing-room, which was ruddy with
      firelight, and fragrant with the breath of the conservatory, and leaning
      over an arm-chair, as he tried to rub the aching out of his brow; &lsquo;there
      were some accounts to finish up and my additions came out different every
      time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A sure sign that you ought to have left off.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was just going to have told my uncle I was good for nothing to-day,
      when I heard old Johns mumbling something to him about Mr. More being
      unwell, and looking up, I saw that cold grey eye twinkling at me, as much
      as to say he was proud to see how soon an Irishman could be beaten. So
      what could I do but give him look for look, and go on with eight and
      seven, and five and two, as unconcerned as he was.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal, &lsquo;you know I think that your uncle&rsquo;s apparent
      indifference may be his fashion of being your best friend.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;d take it like sunshine in May from a stranger, and be proud to
      disappoint him,&rsquo; said Ulick, &lsquo;but to call himself my uncle, and use my
      mother&rsquo;s own eyes to look at me that way, that&rsquo;s the stroke! and to think
      that I&rsquo;m only striving to harden myself by force of habit to be exactly
      like him! I&rsquo;d rather enlist to-morrow, if that would not be his greatest
      triumph!&rsquo; he cried, pressing his hands hard on his temple. &lsquo;It is very
      childish, but I could forgive him anything but using my mother&rsquo;s eyes that
      way!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will yet rejoice in the likeness,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal. &lsquo;You must believe
      in more than you can trace, and when your perseverance has conquered his
      esteem, the rest will follow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Follow? The rest, as you call it, would go before at home,&rsquo; sighed Ulick,
      wearily. &lsquo;Esteem is like fame! what I want begins without it, and lives as
      well with or without it!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps,&rsquo; said his friend, &lsquo;Mr. Goldsmith would think it weakness to show
      preference to a relation before it was earned.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah then,&rsquo; cried Ulick, in a quaint Irish tone, &lsquo;Heaven have mercy on the
      little children!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, the doctrine can only be consistently held by a solitary man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where would we be but for inconsistency?&rsquo; exclaimed Ulick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do not like to hear you talk in that manner,&rsquo; said Sophy.
      &lsquo;Inconsistency is mere weakness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! then you are the dangerous character,&rsquo; said Ulick, with a droll
      gesture of sheltering himself behind the chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I did not call myself consistent, I wish I were,&rsquo; she said, gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How she must love the French!&rsquo; returned Ulick, confidentially turning to
      her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not at all, I detest them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you are inconsistent, for they&rsquo;re the very models of uncompromising
      consistency.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, to bad principles,&rsquo; said Sophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Robespierre was a prime specimen of consistency to good principle!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy turned to her father, and with an odd dubious look, asked him, &lsquo;Is
      be teasing me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;d be proud to have the honour,&rsquo; Ulick made answer, so that Mr.
      Kendal&rsquo;s smile grew broad. It was the funniest thing to see Ulick sporting
      with Sophy&rsquo;s gravity, constraining her to playfulness, with something of
      the compulsion exercised by a large frolicsome puppy upon a sober old dog
      of less size and strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do not like to see powers wasted on paradox,&rsquo; she said, even as the
      grave senior might roll up his lip and snarl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m in earnest, Sophy,&rsquo; pursued Ulick, changing his note to eagerness.
      &lsquo;La grande nation herself finds that logic was her bane. Consistency was
      never made for man! Why where would this world be if it did not go two
      ways at once?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy did laugh at this Irish version of the centripetal and centrifugal
      forces, but she held out. &lsquo;The earth describes a circle; I like straight
      lines.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Much we shall have of the right direction, unless we are content to turn
      right about face,&rsquo; said Ulick. &lsquo;The best path of life is but a
      herring-bone pattern.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What does he know of herring-boning?&rsquo; asked Mrs. Kendal, coming in at the
      moment, with a white cashmere cloak folded picturesquely over her delicate
      blue silk. Ulick in a moment assumed a less careless attitude, as he
      answered&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I found my poetical illustration on the motion of the earth too much for
      her, so I descended to the herring-bone as more suited to her capacity.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There he is, mamma,&rsquo; said Sophy, &lsquo;pleading that consistency is the most
      ruinous thing in the world.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thought as much,&rsquo; said Albinia. &lsquo;Prometheus and his kin do most abound
      when Ulick&rsquo;s head is worst, and papa is in greatest danger of being late.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kendal turned round, looked at the time-piece, and marched off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But mamma!&rsquo; continued Sophy, driving straight at her point, &lsquo;what do you
      think of consistency?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, mamma!&rsquo; cried Lucy, coming into the room in a flutter of white;
      &lsquo;there you are in your beautiful blue! Have you really put it on for the
      Drurys?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy bit her lip, neither pleased at the interruption, nor at the taste.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you a graduated scale of dresses for all your friends, Lucy? asked
      Ulick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Everybody has, I suppose,&rsquo; said Lucy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! then I shall know how to judge how I stand in your favour. I never
      knew so well what the garb of friendship meant.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You must know which way her scale goes,&rsquo; said Albinia, laughing at
      Sophy&rsquo;s evident affront at the frivolous turn the conversation had taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That needs no asking,&rsquo; quoth Ulick, &lsquo;Unadorned, adorned the most for the
      nearest the hearth.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s all conceit,&rsquo; said Lucy. &lsquo;Maybe familiarity breeds contempt.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no, when young ladies despise, they use a precision that says, &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis
      myself I care for, and not you.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What an observer!&rsquo; cried Lucy. &lsquo;Now then, interpret my dress to-night!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How can you, Lucy!&rsquo; muttered the scandalized Sophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, Sophy, as you will have him to torment with philosophy this whole
      evening, I think you might give him a little respite,&rsquo; said Lucy,
      good-humouredly. &lsquo;I want to know what my dress reveals to him!&rsquo; and
      drawing up her head, where two coral pins contrasted with her dark braids,
      and spreading out her full white skirts and cerise trimmings, she threw
      her figure into an attitude, and darted a merry challenge from her lively
      black eyes, while Ulick availed himself of the permission to look
      critically, and Sophy sank back disgusted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Miss Kendal can, when she is inclined, produce as much effect with her
      beams of the second order as with all her splendours displayed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stuff,&rsquo; said Lucy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stuff indeed,&rsquo; more sincerely murmured Sophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Say something in earnest,&rsquo; said Lucy. &lsquo;You professed to tell what I
      thought of the people.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll never put on such new white gloves where I&rsquo;m the party
      chiefly concerned.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They are a great deal too unexceptionable.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      If there were something coquettish in the manner of these two, it did not
      give Albinia much concern. It was in him &lsquo;only Irish;&rsquo; and Fred Ferrars
      had made her believe that it was rather a sign of the absence of love than
      of its presence. She saw much more respect and interest in his mischievous
      attacks on Sophy&rsquo;s gravity, and though Lucy both pitied him and liked
      chattering with him, it was all the while under the secret protest that he
      was only a banker&rsquo;s clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy was glad of the presence of a third person to obviate the perils of
      her evenings with grandmamma, and she beheld the trio set off to their
      dinner-party, without the usual dread of being betrayed into wrangling.
      Mr. O&rsquo;More devoted himself to the old lady&rsquo;s entertainment, he amused her
      with droll stories, and played backgammon with her. Then she composed
      herself to her knitting, and desired them not to mind her, she liked to
      hear young people talk cheerfully; whereupon Sophy, by way of light and
      cheerful conversation, renewed the battle of consistency with a whole
      broadside of heavy metal.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the diners-out came home, they found the war raging as hotly as ever;
      a great many historical facts and wise sayings having been fired off on
      both sides, and neither having found out that each meant the same thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the hours had gone imperceptibly past them, which could not be
      said for the others. The half-yearly dinners at Mr. Drury&rsquo;s were Albinia&rsquo;s
      dread nearly as much as Mr. Kendal&rsquo;s aversion. He was certain, whatever he
      might intend, to fall into a fit of absence, and she was almost equally
      sure to hear something unpleasant, and to regret her own reply. On the
      whole, however, Mr. Kendal came away on this evening the least
      dissatisfied, for Mr. Goldsmith had asked him with some solicitude,
      whether he thought &lsquo;that lad, young More,&rsquo; positively unwell; and had gone
      the length of expressing that he seemed to be fairly sharp, and stuck to
      his work. Mr. Kendal seized the moment for telling his opinion, of Ulick,
      and though Mr. Goldsmith coughed and looked dry and almost contemptuous,
      he was perceptibly gratified, and replied with a maxim evidently intended
      both as an excuse for himself and as a warning to the Kendals, that young
      men were always spoilt by being made too much of&mdash;in his younger days&mdash;&amp;c.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy, meantime, was undergoing the broad banter of her unrefined cousins
      on the subject of the Irish clerk. A very little grace in the perpetration
      would have made it grateful to her vanity, but this was far too broad
      raillery, and made her hold up her head with protestations of her perfect
      indifference, to which her cousins manifested incredulity, visiting on her
      with some petty spite their small jealousies of her higher pretensions,
      and of the attention which had been paid to her by Mr. Cavendish Dusautoy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not that he will ever look at you again, Lucy, you need not flatter
      yourself,&rsquo; said the amiable Sarah Anne. &lsquo;Harry Wolfe writes that he was
      flirting with a beautiful young lady who came to see Oxford, and that he
      is spending quantities of money.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is nothing to me, I am sure,&rsquo; retorted Lucy. &lsquo;Besides, Gilbert says no
      such thing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gilbert! oh, no!&rsquo; exclaimed Miss Drury; &lsquo;why, he is just as bad himself.
      Papa said, from what Mrs. Wolfe told him, he would not take 500 pounds to
      pay Mr. Gilbert&rsquo;s bills.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia had been hearing much the same story from Mrs. Drury, though not
      so much exaggerated, and administered with more condolence. She did not
      absolutely believe, and yet she could not utterly disbelieve, so the
      result was a letter to Gilbert, with an anxious exhortation to be careful,
      and not to be deluded into foolish expenditure in imitation of the
      Polysyllable; and as no special answer was returned, she dismissed the
      whole from her mind as a Drury allegation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The horse chanced to be lame, so that Gilbert could not be met at
      Hadminster on his return from Oxford, but much earlier than the omnibus
      usually lumbered into Bayford, he astonished Sophy, who was lying on the
      sofa in the morning-room, by marching in with a free and easy step, and a
      loose coat of the most novel device.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No one else at home?&rsquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only grandmamma. We did not think the omnibus would come in so soon, but
      I suppose you took a fly, as there were three of you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As if we were going to stand six miles of bus with the Wolfe cub! No,
      Dusautoy brought his horse down with him, and I took a fly!&rsquo; said Gilbert.
      &lsquo;Well, and what&rsquo;s the matter with Captain; has the Irishman been riding
      him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy bit her lip to prevent an angry answer, and was glad that Maurice
      rushed in, fall of uproarious joy. &lsquo;Hollo! boy, how you grow! What have
      you got there?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s my new pop-gun, that Ulick made me, I&rsquo;ll shoot you,&rsquo; cried Maurice,
      retiring to a suitable distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I declare the child has caught the brogue! Is the fellow here still?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What fellow?&rsquo; coldly asked Sophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, this pet of my father&rsquo;s.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bang!&rsquo; cried Maurice, and a pellet passed perilously close to Gilbert&rsquo;s
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t, child. Pray is this banker&rsquo;s clerk one of our fixtures, Sophy?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know why you despise him, unless it is because it is what you
      ought to be yourself,&rsquo; Sophy was provoked into retorting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Apparently my father has a monomania for the article.&rsquo; Gilbert intended
      to speak with provoking coolness; but another fraternal pellet hit him
      fall in the nose, and the accompanying shout of glee was too much for an
      already irritated temper. With passion most unusual in him, he caught hold
      of the child, and exclaiming, &lsquo;You little imp, what do you mean by it?&rsquo; he
      wrenched the weapon out of his hand, and dashed it into the fire, in the
      midst of an energetic &lsquo;For shame!&rsquo; from his sister. Maurice, with a
      furious &lsquo;Naughty Gilbert,&rsquo; struck at him with both his little fists
      clenched, and then precipitated himself over the fender to snatch his
      treasure from the grate, but was instantly captured and pulled back,
      struggling, kicking, and fighting with all his might, till, to the equal
      relief of both brothers, Sophy held up the pop-gun in the tongs, one end
      still tinged with a red glow, smoky, blackened, and perfumed. Maurice made
      one bound, she lowered it into his grasp as the last red spark died out,
      and he clasped it as Siegfried did the magic sword!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There, Maurice, I didn&rsquo;t mean it,&rsquo; said Gilbert, heartily ashamed and
      sorry; &lsquo;kiss and make it up, and then put on your hat, and we&rsquo;ll come up
      to old Smith&rsquo;s and get such a jolly one!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The forgiving child had already given the kiss, glad to atone for his
      aggressions, but then was absorbed in rubbing the charred wood, amazed
      that while so much black came off on his fingers, the effect on the weapon
      was not proportionate, and then tried another shot in a safer direction.
      &lsquo;Come,&rsquo; said Gilbert, &lsquo;put that black affair into the fire, and come
      along.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No!&rsquo; said Maurice; &lsquo;it is my dear gun that Ulick made me, and it shan&rsquo;t
      be burnt.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What, not if I give you a famous one&mdash;like a real one, with a stock
      and barrel?&rsquo; said Gilbert, anxious to be freed from the tokens of his
      ebullition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No! no!&rsquo; still stoutly said the constant Maurice. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want new guns;
      I&rsquo;ve got my dear old one, and I&rsquo;ll keep him to the end of his days and
      mine!&rsquo; and he crossed his arms over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s right, Maurice,&rsquo; said Sophy; &lsquo;stick to old friends that have borne
      wounds in your service!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, it&rsquo;s his concern if he likes such a trumpery old thing,&rsquo; said
      Gilbert. &lsquo;Come here, boy; you don&rsquo;t bear malice! Come and have a ride on
      my back.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The practical lesson, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t shoot at your brother&rsquo;s nose,&rsquo; would never
      have been impressed, had not mamma, on coming in, found Maurice and his
      pop-gun nearly equally black, and by gradual unfolding of cause and
      effect, learnt his forgotten offence. She reminded him of ancient promises
      never to aim at human creatures, assured him that Gilbert was very kind
      not to have burnt it outright; and to the great displeasure, and temporary
      relief of all the family, sequestrated the weapon for the rest of the
      evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy told her in confidence that Gilbert had been the most to blame,
      which she took as merely an instance of Sophy&rsquo;s blindness to Maurice&rsquo;s
      errors; for the explosion had so completely worked off the Oxford dash,
      that he was perfectly meek and amiable. Considering the antecedents, such
      a contrast to himself as young O&rsquo;More could hardly fail to be an eyesore,
      walking tame about the home, and specially recommended to his friendship;
      but so good-natured was he, and so attractive was the Irishman, that it
      took much influence from Algernon Dusautoy to keep up a thriving aversion.
      Albinia marvelled at the power exercised over Gilbert by one whose
      intellect and pretensions he openly contemned, but perceived that
      obstinacy and undoubting self-satisfaction overmastered his superior
      intelligence and principle, and that while perceiving all the follies of
      the Polysyllable, Gilbert had a strange propensity for his company, and
      therein always resumed the fast man, disdainful of the clerk. He did not
      like Ulick better for being the immediate cause of the removal of the last
      traces of the Belmarche family from their old abode, which had been
      renovated by pretty shamrock chintz furniture, the pride of the two Irish
      hearts. Indeed it was to be feared that Bridget would assist in the
      perpetuation of those rolling R&rsquo;s which caused Mr. Goldsmith&rsquo;s brow to
      contract whenever his nephew careered along upon one.
    </p>
    <p>
      His departure from Willow Lawn was to take place at Christmas. The Ferrars
      party were coming to keep the two consecutive birthdays of Sophy and
      Maurice at Bayford, would take him back for Christmas-day to Fairmead, and
      on his return he would take possession of his new rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maurice&rsquo;s fete was to serve as the occasion of paying off civilities to a
      miscellaneous young party; but as grandmamma&rsquo;s feelings would have been
      hurt, had not Sophy&rsquo;s been equally distinguished, it was arranged that
      Mrs. Nugent should then bring her eldest girl to meet the Ferrarses at an
      early tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as Albinia had descended to await her guests, Gilbert came down, and
      presently said, with would-be indifference, &lsquo;Oh, by-the-by, Dusautoy said
      he would look in.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Polysyllable!&rsquo; cried Albinia, thunderstruck; &lsquo;what possessed you to
      ask him, when you knew I sacrificed Mr. Dusautoy rather than have him to
      spoil it all?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t ask him exactly,&rsquo; replied Gilbert; &lsquo;it was old Bowles, who met
      us, and tried to nail us to eat our mutton with him, as he called it. I
      had my answer, and Dusautoy got off by saying he was engaged to us, and
      desired me to tell you he would make his excuses in person.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He can make no excuse for downright falsehood.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hem!&rsquo; quoth Gilbert. &lsquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t have him done into drinking old
      Bowles&rsquo;s surgery champagne.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One comfort is that he wont get any dinner,&rsquo; said Albinia, vindictively.
      &lsquo;I hope he&rsquo;ll be ravenously hungry.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He may not come after all,&rsquo; said Gilbert; and Albinia, laying hold of
      that hope, had nearly forgotten the threatened disaster, as her party
      appeared by instalments, and Winifred owned to her that Sophy had grown
      better-looking than could have been expected. Her eyes had brightened, the
      cloudy brown of her cheeks was enlivened, she held herself better, and the
      less childish dress was much to her advantage. But above all, the moody
      look of suffering was gone, and her face had something of the grave
      sweetness and regular beauty of that of her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Seventeen,&rsquo; said Mrs. Ferrars; &lsquo;by the time she is seventy, she may be a
      remarkably handsome woman!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The tea-drinking was in lively operation, when after a thundering knock,
      Mr. Cavendish Dusautoy was ushered in, with the air of a prince honouring
      the banquet of his vassals, saying, &lsquo;I told Kendal I should presume on
      your hospitality, I beg you will make no difference on my account.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Of which gracious permission Albinia was resolved to avail herself. She
      left all the insincerity to her husband, and would by no means allow
      grandmamma to abdicate the warm corner. She suspected that he wanted an
      introduction to Mrs. Nugent, and was resolved to defeat this object,
      unless he should condescend to make the request, so she was well satisfied
      to see him wedged in between papa and Sophy, while a prodigious quantity
      of Irish talk was going on between Mrs. Nugent and Mr. O&rsquo;More, with
      contributions of satire from Mr. Ferrars which kept every one laughing
      except little Nora Nugent and Mary Ferrars, who were deep in the
      preliminaries of an eternal friendship, and held the ends of each other&rsquo;s
      crackers like a pair of doves. Lucy, however, was ill at ease at the
      obscurity which shrouded the illustrious guest, and in her anxiety, gave
      so little attention to her two neighbours, that Willie Ferrars, affronted
      at some neglect, exclaimed, &lsquo;Why, Lucy, what makes you screw your eyes
      about so! you can&rsquo;t attend to any one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is because Polly Silly is there,&rsquo; shouted Master Maurice from his
      throne beside his mamma.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the infinite relief of the half-choked Albinia, little Mary Ferrars,
      with whom her cousin had been carrying on a direful warfare all day,
      fitted on the cap, shook her head gravely at him, and after an appealing
      look of indignation, first at his mamma, then at her own, was overheard
      confiding to Nora Nugent that Maurice was a very naughty boy&mdash;she was
      sorry to say, a regular spoilt child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But how should you hinder Miss Kendal from attending?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you, darling. Poor Lucy! she is very fond of me, and I dare say
      she wanted me to sit next to her, but you know she will have me for three
      days, and I have you only this one evening. I&rsquo;ll go and speak to her after
      tea, when we go into the drawing-room, and then she wont mind.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy, after an agony of blushes, had somewhat recovered on finding that no
      one seemed to apply her brother&rsquo;s speech, and when the benevolent Mary
      made her way to her, and thrust a hand into hers, only a feeble pressure
      replied to these romantic blandishments, so anxious was she to carry to
      Mrs. Kendal the information that Mr. Cavendish Dusautoy had been so
      obliging as to desire his servant to bring his guitar and key-bugle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We are much obliged,&rsquo; said Albinia, &lsquo;but look at that face!&rsquo; and she
      turned Lucy towards Willie&rsquo;s open-mouthed, dismayed countenance. You must
      tell him the company are not sufficiently advanced in musical science.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But mamma, it would gratify him!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very likely&rsquo;&mdash;and without listening further, Albinia turned to
      Willie, who had all day been insisting that papa should introduce her to
      the new game of the Showman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Infinitely delighted to be relieved from the fear of the guitar, Willie
      hunted all who would play into another room; whence they were to be
      summoned, one by one, back to the drawing-room by the showman, Mr.
      Ferrars, who shrugged his shoulders at the task, but undertook it, and
      first called for Mrs. Kendal.
    </p>
    <p>
      She found him stationed before the red curtains, which were closely drawn,
      and her husband and the three elder ladies sitting by as audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pray, madam, may I ask what animal you would desire to have exhibited to
      you, out of the vast resources that my menagerie contains. Choose freely,
      I undertake that whatever you may select, you shall not be disappointed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What, not if I were to ask for a black spider monkey?&rsquo; said Albinia, to
      whom it was very charming to be playing with Maurice again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kendal looked up in entertained curiosity, Mrs. Nugent smiled as if
      she thought the showman&rsquo;s task impossible, and Winifred stretched out to
      gain a full view.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A black spider monkey,&rsquo; he said, slowly. &lsquo;Allow me to ask, madam, if you
      are acquainted with the character of the beast?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It doesn&rsquo;t scratch, does it?&rsquo; said she, quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is for you to answer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never knew it do so. It does chatter a great deal, but it never
      scratched that I knew of.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nor I,&rsquo; said the showman, &lsquo;since it was young. Do you think age renders
      it graver and steadier?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a bit. It is always frisky and troublesome, and I never knew it get a
      bit better as it grew older.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Winifred laughed outright. Mr. Kendal&rsquo;s lips were parted by his smile. &lsquo;I
      wonder what sort of a mother it would make?&rsquo; said the showman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All animals are good mothers, of course.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I meant, is it a good disciplinarian?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you mean cuffing its young one for playing exactly the same tricks as
      itself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Exactly; and what would be the effect of letting it and its young one
      loose in a great scholar&rsquo;s study?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There wouldn&rsquo;t be much study left.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And would it be for his good?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Really, Mr. Showman, you ask very odd questions. Shall we try?&rsquo; said
      Albinia, with a skip backward, so as to lay her hand on the shoulder of
      her own great scholar, while the showman drew back the curtain, observing&mdash;&lsquo;I
      wish, ma&rsquo;am, I could show &ldquo;it and its young one&rdquo; together, but the young
      specimen is unfortunately asleep. Behold the original black spider
      monkey!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There stood the monkey, with sunny brown locks round the laughing glowing
      face, and one white paw still lying on the scholar&rsquo;s shoulder&mdash;while
      his face made no assurance needful that it was very good for him! The
      mirror concealed behind the curtains was the menagerie! Albinia clapped
      her hands with delight, and pronounced it the most perfect of games.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And now let us have Willie,&rsquo; said Mrs. Ferrars; &lsquo;it will conduce to the
      harmony of the next room.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Willie, already initiated, hoped to puzzle papa as a platypus
      ornithoryncus, but was driven to allow that it was a nondescript animal,
      neither fish, flesh, nor good red-herring, useless, and very fond of
      grubbing in the mud; and if it were not at Botany Bay, it ought to be! The
      laughter that hailed his defence of its nose as &lsquo;well, nothing
      particular,&rsquo; precipitated the drawing up of the curtain and his apparition
      in the glass: and then Nora Nugent being called, the inseparable Mary
      accompanied her, arm-in-arm, simpering an announcement that they liked
      nothing so well as a pair of dear little love-birds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, unpitying papa! to draw from the unsuspicious Nora the admission that
      they were very dull little birds, of no shape at all, who always sat
      hunched up in a corner without any fun, and people said their love was all
      stupidity and pretence; in fact, if she had one she should call it Silly
      Polly or Polly Silly!
    </p>
    <p>
      To silence Willie&rsquo;s exultation in his sister&rsquo;s discomfiture, he was sent
      to fetch Lucy, whose impersonation of an argus pheasant would not have
      answered well but for a suggestion of Albinia, that she was eyes all over
      for any delinquency in school. Ulick O&rsquo;More, owning with a sigh that he
      should like to see no beast better than a snipe, gave rise to much
      ingenuity by being led to describe it as of a class migratory, hard to
      catch, food for powder, given to long bills. There he guessed something,
      and stood on the defensive, but could not deny that its element was bogs,
      but that it had been seen skimming over water meadows, and finding
      sustenance in banks, whereupon the curtain rose. Ulick rushed upon the
      battles of his nation, and was only reduced to quiescence by the entrance
      of Sophy, who expressed a desire to see a coral worm, apparently
      perplexing the showman, who, to gain time, hemmed, and said, &lsquo;A very
      unusual species, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; which set all the younger ones in a double
      giggle, such as confused Sophy, to find herself standing up, with every
      one looking at her, and listening for her words. &lsquo;I thought you undertook
      for any impossibility in earth air or water.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, ma&rsquo;am, do you take me for a mere mountebank? But when ladies and
      gentlemen take such unusual fancies&mdash;and for an animal that&mdash;you
      would not aver that it is often found from home?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never, I should say.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nor that it is accessible?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly not.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And why is it so, ma&rsquo;am?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why,&rsquo; said Sophy, bewildered into forgetting her natural history, &lsquo;it
      lives at the bottom of the sea; that&rsquo;s one thing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where Truth lives,&rsquo; said a voice behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I beg to differ,&rsquo; observed Albinia. &lsquo;Truth is a fresh water fish at the
      bottom of a well; besides, I thought coral worms were always close to the
      surface.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But below it&mdash;not in everybody&rsquo;s view,&rsquo; said Sophy&mdash;an answer
      which seemed much to the satisfaction of the audience, but the showman
      insisted on knowing why, and whether it did not conceal itself. &lsquo;It makes
      stony caves for itself, out of sight,&rsquo; said Sophy, almost doubting whether
      she spoke correctly. &lsquo;Well, surely it does so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Most surely,&rsquo; said an acclamation so general that she did not like it. If
      she had been younger, she would have turned sulky upon the spot, and Mr.
      Ferrars almost doubted whether to bring ont his final query. &lsquo;Pray, ma&rsquo;am,
      do you think this creature out of reach in its self-made cave, at the
      bottom&mdash;no, below the surface of the sea, would be popular enough to
      repay the cost of procuring it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! that&rsquo;s too bad,&rsquo; burst out the Hibernian tones. &lsquo;Why, is not the best
      of everything hidden away from the common eye? Out of sight&mdash;stony
      cave&mdash;It is the secret worker that lays the true solid foundation,
      raises the new realms, and forms the precious jewels.&rsquo; The torrent of r&rsquo;s
      was irresistible!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Police! order!&rsquo; cried the showman. &lsquo;An Irish mob has got in, and there&rsquo;s
      an end of everything.&rsquo; So up went the curtain, and the polyp appeared,
      becoming rapidly red coral as she perceived what the exhibition was, and
      why the politeness of the Green Isle revolted from her proclaiming her own
      unpopularity. But all she did was to turn gruffly aside, and say, &lsquo;It is
      lucky there are no more ladies to come, Mr. Showman, or the mob would turn
      everything to a compliment.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert&rsquo;s curiosity was directed to the Laughing Jackass, and with too
      much truth he admitted that it took its tone from whatever it associated
      with, and caught every note, from the song of the lark to the bray of the
      donkey; then laughed good-humouredly when the character was fitted upon
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is all, is it not?&rsquo; asked the showman. &lsquo;I may retire into private
      life.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh no,&rsquo; cried Willie; &lsquo;you have forgotten Mr. Dusautoy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was afraid you had,&rsquo; said Lucy, &lsquo;or you could not have left him to the
      last.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am tempted to abdicate,&rsquo; said Mr. Ferrars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; Albinia said. &lsquo;He must have his share, and no one but you can do it.
      Where can he be? the pause becomes awful!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Willie is making suggestions,&rsquo; said Gilbert; &lsquo;his imagination would never
      stretch farther than a lion. It&rsquo;s what he thinks himself and no mistake.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is big enough to be the elephant,&rsquo; said little Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The half-reasoning!&rsquo; said Ulick, softly; &lsquo;and I can answer for his trunk,
      I saw it come off the omnibus.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ladies and gentlemen, if you persist in such disorderly conduct, the
      exhibition will close,&rsquo; cried the showman, waving his wand as Willie
      trumpeted Mr. Cavendish Dusautoy in, and on the demand what animal he
      wanted to see, twitched him as Flibbertigibbet did the giant warder, and
      caused him to respond&mdash;&lsquo;The Giraffe.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Has it not another name, sir? A short or a long one, more or less
      syllables!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Camelopard. A polysyllabic word, certainly,&rsquo; said Algernon, looking with
      a puzzled expression at the laughers behind; and almost imagining it
      possible that he could have made an error, he repeated, &lsquo;Camel-le-o-pard.
      Yes, it is a polysyllable&rsquo;&mdash;as, indeed, he had added an unnecessary
      syllable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Most assuredly,&rsquo; said the showman, looking daggers at his suffocating
      sister. &lsquo;May I ask you to describe the creature?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Seventeen feet from the crown to the hoof, but falls off behind,&rsquo; said
      the accurate Mr. Dusautoy; &lsquo;beautiful tawny colour.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nearly as good as a Lion,&rsquo; added Gilbert; but Algernon, fancying the game
      was by way of giving useful instruction to the children, went on in full
      swing. &lsquo;Handsomely mottled with darker brown; a ruminating animal; so
      gentle that in spite of its size, none of my little friends need be
      alarmed at its vicinity. Inhabits the African deserts, but may be bred in
      more temperate latitudes. I myself saw an individual in the Jardin des
      Plantes, which was popularly said never to bend its neck to the ground,
      but I consider this a vulgar delusion, for on offering it food, it mildly
      inclined its head.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let us hope the present specimen is equally condescending,&rsquo; said Mr.
      Ferrars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Eh! what! I see myself!&rsquo; said Mr. Cavendish Dusautoy, with a tone so
      inappreciably grand in mystification, that the showman had no choice but
      to share the universal convulsion of laughter, while Willie rolling on the
      floor with ecstasy, shouted, &lsquo;Yes, it is you that are the thing with such
      a long name that it can&rsquo;t bend its head to the ground!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But too good-natured to be annoyed at folly,&rsquo; said Mr. Ferrars,
      perceiving that it was no sport to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is the way my mischievous uncle has served us all in turn,&rsquo; said
      Lucy, advancing; &lsquo;we have all been shown up, and there was mamma a monkey,
      and I an argus pheasant&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! I see,&rsquo; said the gentleman. &lsquo;These are your rural pastimes of the
      season. Yes, I can take my share in good part, just as I have pelted the
      masks at the Carnival.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Even a giraffe can bend his head and do at Rome as Rome does,&rsquo; murmured
      Ulick. But instead of heeding the audacious Irishman, Algernon patronized
      the showman by thanks for his exhibition; and then sitting down by Lucy,
      asked if he had ever told her of the tricks that he and il Principe
      Odorico Moretti used to play at Ems on the old Baron Sprawlowsky, while
      Mr. Ferrars, leaning over his sister&rsquo;s chair, said aside, &lsquo;I beg your
      pardon, Albinia; I should not have yielded to Willie. This &ldquo;rural pastime&rdquo;
       is only in season en famille.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never mind, it served him right.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It may have served him right, but had we the right to serve him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I forgive your prudence for the sake of your folly. Could not Oxford have
      lessened his pomposity?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It comes too late,&rsquo; said Maurice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Ulick went to bed his pen and ink had depicted the entire caravan.
      The love-birds were pressed up together, with the individual features of
      the two young ladies, and completely little parrots; the snipe ran along
      the bars of the cage, looking exactly like all the O&rsquo;Mores. The monkey
      showed nothing but the hands, but one held Maurice, and the other was
      clenched as if to cuff him, and grandest of all was, as in duty bound,
      Camelopardelis giraffa, thrown somewhat backwards, with such a majestic
      form, such a stalking attitude, loftily ruminating face, and legs so like
      the Cavendish Dusautoy&rsquo;s last new pair of trousers, that Albinia could not
      help reserving it for the private delectation of his Aunt Fanny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It and its young one,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal, as he looked at her portrait; and
      the name delighted him so much, that he for some time applied it with a
      smile whenever his wife gave him cause to remember how much there was of
      the monkey in her composition.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the merriest Christmas ever known at Willow Lawn, and the first
      time there had been anything of the atmosphere of family frolic and fun.
      The lighting up of Sophy was one great ingredient; hitherto mirth had been
      merely endured by her, whereas now, improved health and spirits had made
      her take her share, amuse others and be amused, and cease to be hurt by
      the jarring of chance words. Lucy was lively as usual, but rather more
      excited than Albinia altogether liked; she was doubly particular about her
      dress; more disdainful of the common herd, and had a general air of
      exaltation that made Albinia rejoice when the Polysyllable, the horses,
      the key-bugle, and genre painting disappeared from the Bayford horizon.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      If the end of the vacation were a relief on Lucy&rsquo;s account, Albinia would
      gladly have lengthened it on Gilbert&rsquo;s. Letters from his tutor had
      disquieted his father; there had been an expostulation followed by
      promises, and afterwards one of the usual scenes of argument, complaint,
      excuse, lamentation, and wish to amend; but lastly, a murmur that it was
      no use to talk to a father who had never been at the University, and did
      not know what was expected of a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The aspect of Oxford had changed in Albinia&rsquo;s eyes since the days of her
      brother. Alma Mater had been a vision of pealing bells, chanting voices,
      cloistered shades, bright waters&mdash;the source of her most cherished
      thoughts, the abode of youth walking in the old paths of pleasantness and
      peace; and she knew that to faithful hearts, old Oxford was still the
      same. But to her present anxious gaze it had become a field of snares and
      temptations, whither she had been the means of sending one, unguarded and
      unstable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once under the influence of a good sound-hearted friend, he might have
      been easily led right, but his intimacy with young Dusautoy seemed to
      cancel all hope of this, and to be like a rope about his neck, drawing him
      into the same career, and keeping aloof all better influences. Algernon,
      with his pride, pomposity, and false refinement, was more likely to run
      into ostentations expenditure, than into coarse dissipation, and it might
      still be hoped that the two youths would drag through without public
      disgrace; but this was felt to be a very poor hope by those who felt each
      sin to be a fatal blot, and trembled at the self-indulgent way of life
      that might be a more fatal injury than even the ban of the authorities.
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw that the anxiety pressed heavily on Mr. Kendal, and though both
      shrank from giving their uneasiness force by putting it into words, each
      felt that it was ever-present with the other. Mr. Kendal was deeply
      grieving over the effects, for the former state of ignorance and apathy of
      the evils of which he had only recently become fully sensible. Living for
      himself alone, without cognizance of his membership in one great universal
      system, he had needed the sense of churchmanship to make him act up to his
      duties as father, neighbour, citizen, and man of property; and when
      aroused, he found that the time of his inaction had bound him about with
      fetters. A tone of mind had grown up in his family from which only Sophy
      had been entirely freed; seeds of ineradicable evil had been sown,
      mischiefs had grown by neglect, abuses been established by custom; and his
      own personal disadvantages, his mauvaise honte, his reserved, apparently
      proud manner, his slowness of speech, dislike to interruption, and
      over-vehemence when excited, had so much increased upon him, as, in spite
      of his efforts, to be serious hindrances. Kind, liberal, painstaking, and
      conscientious as he had become, he was still looked upon as hard, stern,
      and tyrannical. His ten years of inertness had strewn his path with thorns
      and briars, even beyond his own household; and when he looked back to his
      neglect of his son, he felt that even the worst consequences would be but
      just retribution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once such feelings would have wrapt him in morbid gloom; now he strove
      against his disposition to sit inert and hidden, he did his work manfully,
      and endeavoured not to let his want of spirits sadden the household.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was he insensible to the cheerful healthy atmosphere of animation
      which had diffused itself there; and the bright discussions of the
      trifling interests of the day. Ulick O&rsquo;More was also a care to him, which
      did him a great deal of good.
    </p>
    <p>
      That young gentleman now lived at his lodgings, but was equally at home at
      Willow Lawn, and his knock at the library door, when he wished to change a
      book, usually led to some &lsquo;Prometheus&rsquo; discussion, and sometimes to a
      walk, if Mr. Kendal thought him looking pale; or to dining and to spending
      the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      His scrapes were peculiar. He had thoroughly mastered his work, and his
      active mind wanted farther scope, so that he threw himself with avidity
      into deeper studies, and once fell into horrible disgrace for being
      detected with a little Plato on his desk. Mr. Goldsmith nearly gave him up
      in despair, and pronounced that he would never make a man of business. He
      made matters worse by replying that this was the best chance of his not
      being a man of speculation. If he were allowed to think of nothing but
      money, he should speculate for the sake of something to do!
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Mr. Goldsmith had half recovered the shock, Mr. Dusautoy and Mr.
      Hope laid violent hands upon young O&rsquo;More for the evening school twice a
      week, which almost equally discomposed his aunt. She had never got over
      the first blow of Mr. Dusautoy&rsquo;s innovations, and felt as if her nephew
      had gone over to the enemy. She was doubly ungracious at the Sunday
      dinner, and venomously critical of the choir&rsquo;s chanting, Mr. Hope&rsquo;s voice,
      and the Vicar&rsquo;s sermons.
    </p>
    <p>
      The worst scrape came in March. The Willow Lawn ladies were in the lower
      end of the garden, which, towards the river, was separated from the lane
      that continued Tibb&rsquo;s Alley, by a low wall surmounted by spikes, and with
      a disused wicket, always locked, and nearly concealed by a growth of
      laurels; when out brake a horrible hullabaloo in that region of evil
      report, the shouts and yells coming nearer, and becoming so distinct that
      they were about to retreat, when suddenly a dark figure leapt over the
      gate, and into the garden, amid a storm of outcries. As he disappeared
      among the laurels, Albinia caught up Maurice, Lucy screamed and prepared
      to fly, and Sophy started forward, exclaiming, &lsquo;It is Ulick, mamma; his
      face is bleeding!&rsquo; But as he emerged, she retreated, for she had a nervous
      terror of the canine race, and in his hand, at arm&rsquo;s length he held by the
      neck a yellow dog, a black pot dangling from its tail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take care,&rsquo; he shouted, as Albinia set down Maurice, and was running up
      to him; &lsquo;he may be mad.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Maurice was caught up again, Lucy shrieked, and Sophy, tottering against
      an apple-tree, faintly said, &lsquo;He has bitten you!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, not he; it was only a stone,&rsquo; said Ulick, as best he might, with a
      fast bleeding upper lip. &lsquo;They were hunting the poor beast to death&mdash;I
      believe he&rsquo;s no more mad than I am&mdash;only with the fright&mdash;but
      best make sure.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fetch some milk, Lucy,&rsquo; said Albinia. &lsquo;Take Maurice with you. No, don&rsquo;t
      take the poor thing down to the river, he&rsquo;ll only think you are going to
      drown him. Go, Maurice dear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Maurice safe, Albinia was able to find ready expedients after Sir Fowell
      Buxton&rsquo;s celebrated example. She brought Ulick the gardener&rsquo;s thick
      gauntlets from the tool-house, and supplied him with her knife, with which
      he set the poor creature free from the instrument of torture, and then let
      him loose, with a pan of milk before him, in the old-fashioned
      summer-house, through the window of which he could observe his motions,
      and if he looked dangerous, shoot him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing could look less dangerous; the poor creature sank down on the
      floor and moaned, licked its hind leg, and then dragged itself as if
      famished to the milk, lapped a little eagerly, but lay down again whining,
      as if in pain. Ulick and Albinia called to it, and it looked up and tried
      to wag its tail, whining appealingly. &lsquo;My poor brute!&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;they&rsquo;ve
      treated you worse than a heathen. That&rsquo;s all&mdash;let me see what I can
      do for you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, but yourself, Ulick,&rsquo; said Albinia, as in his haste he took down his
      handkerchief from his mouth; &lsquo;I do believe your lip is cut through! You
      had better attend to that first.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no, thank you,&rsquo; said Ulick, eagerly, &lsquo;they&rsquo;ve broken the poor
      wretch&rsquo;s leg!&rsquo; and he was the next moment sitting on the summer-house
      floor, lifting up the animal tenderly, regardless of her expostulation
      that the injured, frightened creature might not know its friends. But she
      did it injustice; it wagged its stumpy tail, and licked his fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      She offered to fetch rag for his surgery, and he farther begged for some
      slight bits of wood to serve as splints, he and his brothers had been
      dog-doctors before. As she hurried into the house, Sophy, who had sunk on
      a sofa in the drawing-room, looking deadly pale, called out, &lsquo;Is he
      bitten?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; cried Albinia, hurrying on, &lsquo;the dog is all safe. It has only
      got a broken leg.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Maurice, with whom Lucy had all this time been fighting, came out with her
      to see the rest of the adventure; and thought it very cruel that he was
      not permitted to touch the patient, which bore the operation with
      affecting fortitude and gratitude, and was then consigned to a basket
      lined with hay, and left in the summer-house, Mr. Kendal being known to
      have an almost eastern repugnance to dogs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Ulick had leisure to be conducted to the morning-room, and be
      rendered a less ghastly spectacle, by some very uncomfortable
      sticking-plaster moustaches, which hardly permitted him to narrate his
      battle distinctly. He thought the boys, even of Tibb&rsquo;s Alley, would hardly
      have ventured any violence after he had interfered, but for some young men
      who aught to have known better; he fancied he had seen young Tritton of
      Robbles Leigh, and he was sure of an insolent groom whom Mr. Cavendish
      Dusautoy, to the great vexation of his uncle, had recently sent down with
      a horse to the King&rsquo;s Head. They had stimulated the boys to a shout of
      Paddy and a shower of stones, and Ulick expected credit for great
      discretion, in having fled instead of fought. &lsquo;Ah! if Brian and Connel had
      but been there, wouldn&rsquo;t we have put them to the rout?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing would then serve him but going back to Tibb&rsquo;s Alley to trace the
      dog&rsquo;s history, and meantime Lucy, from the end of the passage, beckoned to
      Albinia, and whispered mysteriously that &lsquo;Sophy would not have any one
      know it for the world&mdash;but,&rsquo; said Lucy, &lsquo;I found her absolutely
      fainting away on the sofa, only she would not let me call you, and ordered
      that no one should know anything about it. But, mamma, there was a red-hot
      knitting-needle sticking out of the fire, and I am quite sure that she
      meant if Ulick was bitten, to burn out the place.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia believed Sophy capable of both the resolution and its consequence;
      but she agreed with Lucy that no notice should be taken, and would not
      seem aware that Sophy was much paler than usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dog, as well as Ulick could make out, was a waif or stray, belonging
      to a gipsy deported that morning by the police, and on whom its master&rsquo;s
      sins had been visited. So without scruple he carried the basket home to
      his lodgings, and on the way, had the misfortune to encounter his uncle,
      while shirtfront, coat, and waistcoat were fresh from the muddy and bloody
      fray, and his visage in the height of disfigurement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Goldsmith looked on the whole affair as an insult to every Goldsmith
      of past ages! A mere street row! He ordered Mr. More to his lodgings, and
      said he should hear from him to-morrow. Ulick came down to Willow Lawn in
      the dark, almost considering himself as dismissed, not knowing whether to
      be glad or sorry; and wanting to consult Mr. Kendal whether it would be
      possible to work his way at college as Mr. Hope had done, or even
      wondering whether he might venture to beg for a recommendation to &lsquo;Kendal
      and Kendal.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kendal was so strongly affected, that he took up his hat and went
      straight to Mr. Goldsmith, &lsquo;to put the matter before him in a true light.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      True light or false, it was intolerable in the banker&rsquo;s eyes, and it took
      a great deal of eloquence to persuade him that his nephew was worth a
      second trial. Fighting in Tibb&rsquo;s Alley over a gipsy&rsquo;s dog, and coming back
      looking like a ruffian! Mr. Goldsmith wished him no harm, but it would be
      a disgrace to the concern to keep him on, and Miss Goldsmith, whom Mr.
      Kendal heartily wished to gag, chimed in with her old predictions of the
      consequences of her poor sister&rsquo;s foolish marriage. The final argument,
      was Mr. Kendal&rsquo;s declaration of the testimonials with which he would at
      once send him out to Calcutta, to take the situation once offered to his
      own son. No sooner did Mr. Goldsmith hear that his nephew had an
      alternative, than he promised to be lenient, and finally dispatched a
      letter to U. More, Esquire, with a very serious rebuke, but a promise that
      his conduct should be overlooked, provided the scandal were not repeated,
      and he should not present himself at the bank till his face should be fit
      to be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kendal mounted him the next morning on Gilbert&rsquo;s horse, and sent him
      to Fairmead. The dog was left in charge of Bridget, who treated it with
      abundant kindness, but failed to obtain the exclusive affection which the
      poor thing lavished upon its rescuer. By the time Ulick came home, it had
      arrived at limping upon three legs, and was bent on following him wherever
      he went. Disreputable and heinously ugly it was, of tawny currish yellow
      (whence it was known as the Orange-man), with a bull-dog countenance; and
      the legs that did not limp were bandy. Albinia called it the Tripod, but
      somehow it settled into the title of Hyder Ali, to which it was said to
      &lsquo;answer&rsquo; the most readily, though it would in fact answer anything from
      Ulick, and nothing from any one else..
    </p>
    <p>
      Ever at his heels, the &lsquo;brazen Tripod&rsquo; contrived to establish an entrance
      at Willow Lawn; scratched till Mr. Kendal would interrupt a &lsquo;Prometheus
      talk&rsquo; to let him in at the library door; and gradually made it a matter of
      course to come into the drawing-room, and repose upon Sophy&rsquo;s flounces.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was by way of compensation for his misadventures elsewhere. He was
      always bringing Ulick into trouble; shut or tie him up as he might, he was
      sure to reappear when least wanted. He had been at church, he had been in
      Miss Goldsmith&rsquo;s drawing-room, he had been found times without number
      curled up under Ulick&rsquo;s desk. Mr. Goldsmith growled hints about hanging
      him, and old Mr. Johns, who really was fond of his bright young fellow
      clerk, gave grave counsel; but Ulick only loved his protege the better,
      and after having exhausted an Irish vocabulary of expostulation, succeeded
      in prevailing on him to come no farther than the street; except on very
      wet days, when he would sometimes be found on the mat in the entry,
      looking deplorably beseeching, and bringing on his master an irate,
      &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s that dog again!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Would that no one fell into worse scrapes,&rsquo; sighed Mr. Dusautoy, when he
      heard of Ulick&rsquo;s disasters with Hyder Ali, and it was a sigh that the
      house of Kendal re-echoed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody could be surprised when, towards the long vacation, tidings came to
      Bayford, that after long forbearance on the part of the authorities, the
      insubordination and riotous conduct of the two young men could be endured
      no longer. It appeared that young Dusautoy, with his weak head and
      obstinate will, had never attempted to bend to rules, but had taken every
      reproof as an insult and defiance. Young men had not been wanting who were
      ready to take advantage of his lavish expenditure, and to excite his
      disdain for authorities. They had promoted the only wit he did understand,
      broad practical jokes and mischief; and had led him into the riot and
      gambling to which he was not naturally prone. Gilbert Kendal, with more
      sense and principle, had been led on by the contagion around him, and at
      last an outrageous wine party had brought matters to a crisis. The most
      guilty were the most cunning, and the only two to whom the affair could
      actually be brought home, were Dusautoy and Kendal. The sentence was
      rustication, and the tutor wrote to Mr. Dusautoy, as the least immediately
      affected, to ask him to convey the intelligence to Mr. Kendal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vicar was not a man to shrink from any task, however painful, but he
      felt it the more deeply, as, in spite of his partiality, he was forced to
      look on his own favourite Algernon as the misleader of Gilbert; and when
      he overtook the sisters on his melancholy way down the hill, he consulted
      them how their father would bear it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; said Lucy; &lsquo;he&rsquo;ll be terribly angry. I should not
      wonder if he sent Gilbert straight off to India; should you, Sophy?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope he will do nothing in haste,&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Dusautoy. &lsquo;I do
      believe if those two lads were but separated, or even out of such company,
      they would both do very well.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; exclaimed Lucy; &lsquo;and, after all, they are such absurd regulations,
      treating men like schoolboys, wanting them to keep such regular
      troublesome hours. Mr. Cavendish Dusautoy told me that there was no
      enduring the having everything enforced.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If things had been enforced on poor Algernon earlier, this might never
      have been,&rsquo; sighed his uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t see why papa should mind it so much,&rsquo; continued Lucy.
      &lsquo;Mr. Cavendish Dusautoy told me his friend Lord Reginald Raymond had been
      rusticated twice, and expelled at last.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you think of it, Sophy?&rsquo; asked the vicar, anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t feel as if any of us could ever look up again,&rsquo; she answered very
      low.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, no; not that exactly. It is not quite the right way to take these
      things, Sophy,&rsquo; said Mr. Dusautoy. &lsquo;Boys may be very foolish and
      wrong-headed, without disgracing their family.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy did not answer&mdash;it was all too fresh and sore, and she did not
      find much consolation in the number of youths whom Lucy reckoned up as
      having incurred the like penalty. When they entered the house, and Mr.
      Dusautoy knocked at the library door, she followed Lucy into the garden,
      without knowing where she was going, and threw herself down upon the
      grass, miserable at the pain which was being inflicted upon her father,
      and with a hardened resentful feeling, between contempt and anger, against
      the brother, who, for very weakness, could so dishonour and grieve him.
      She clenched her hand in the intensity of her passionate thoughts and
      impulses, and sat like a statue, while Lucy, from time to time, between
      the tying up of flowers and watering of annuals, came up with inconsistent
      exhortations not to be so unhappy&mdash;for it was not expulsion&mdash;it
      was sure to be unjust&mdash;nobody would think the worse of them because
      young men were foolish&mdash;all men of spirit did get into scrapes&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was lucky for Lucy that all this passed by Sophy&rsquo;s ear as unheeded as
      the babbling of the brook. She did not move, till roused by Ulick O&rsquo;More,
      coming up from the bridge, telling that he had met some Irish haymakers in
      the meadows, and saying he wanted to beg a frock for one of their
      children.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think I can find you one,&rsquo; said Lucy, &lsquo;if you will wait a minute; but
      don&rsquo;t go in, Mr. Dusautoy is there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is anything the matter?&rsquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Every one must soon know,&rsquo; said Lucy; &lsquo;it is of no use to keep it back,
      Sophy. Only my brother and Mr. Cavendish Dusautoy have got into a scrape
      about a wine party, and are going to be rusticated. But wait, I&rsquo;ll fetch
      the frock.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy had almost run away while her sister spoke, but the kind look of
      consternation and pity on Ulick&rsquo;s face deterred her, he in soliloquy
      repeated, as if confounded by the greatness of the misfortune, &lsquo;Poor
      Gilbert!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor Gilbert!&rsquo; burst from Sophy in irritation at misplaced sympathy; &lsquo;I
      thought it would be papa and mamma you cared for!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With reason,&rsquo; returned Ulick, &lsquo;but I was thinking how it must break his
      heart to have pained such as they.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish he would feel it thus,&rsquo; exclaimed Sophy; &lsquo;but he never will!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! banish that notion, Sophy,&rsquo; cried Ulick, recoiling at the indignation
      in her dark eyes, &lsquo;next to grieving my mother, I declare nothing could
      crush me like meeting a look such as that from a sister of mine.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How can I help it?&rsquo; she said, reserve breaking down in her vehemence,
      &lsquo;when I think how much papa has suffered&mdash;how much Gilbert has to
      make up to him&mdash;how mamma took him for her own&mdash;how they have
      borne with him, and set their happiness on him, and yielded to his
      fancies, only for him to disappoint them so cruelly, and just because he
      can&rsquo;t say No! I hope he wont come home; I shall never know how to speak to
      him!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But all that makes it so much the worse for him,&rsquo; said Ulick, in a tone
      of amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, you can&rsquo;t understand,&rsquo; she answered; &lsquo;if he had had one spark of
      feeling like you, he would rather have died than have gone on as he has
      done.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Surely many a man may be overtaken in a fault, and never be wrong at
      heart,&rsquo; said Ulick. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s many a worse sin than what the world sets a
      blot upon, and I believe that is just why homes were made.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy came back with the frock, and Ulick, thanking her, sped away; while
      Sophy slowly went upstairs and hid herself on her couch. For a woman to
      find a man thinking her over-hard and severe, is sure either to harden or
      to soften her very decidedly, and it was a hard struggle which would be
      the effect. There was an inclination at first to attribute his surprise to
      the lax notions and foolish fondness of his home, where no doubt far worse
      disorders than Gilbert&rsquo;s were treated as mere matters of course. But such
      strong pity for the offender did not seem to accord with this; and the
      more she thought, the more sure she became that it was the fresh charity
      and sweetness of an innocent spirit, &lsquo;believing all things,&rsquo; and
      separating the fault from the offender. His words had fallen on her ear in
      a sense beyond what he meant. Pride and uncharitable resentment might be
      worse sins than mere weakness and excess. She thought of the elder son in
      the parable, who, unknowing of his brother&rsquo;s temptation and sorrow, closed
      his heart against his return; and if her tears would have come, she would
      have wept that she could not bring herself to look on Gilbert otherwise
      than as the troubler of her father&rsquo;s peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      When her mother at last came upstairs, she only ventured to ask gently,
      &lsquo;How does papa bear it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It did not come without preparation,&rsquo; was the answer; &lsquo;and at first we
      were occupied with comforting Mr. Dusautoy, who takes to himself all the
      shame his nephew will not feel, for having drawn poor Gilbert into such a
      set.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And papa?&rsquo; still asked Sophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is very quiet, and it is not easy to tell. I believe it was a great
      mistake, though not of his making, to send Gilbert to Oxford at all, and I
      doubt whether he will ever go back again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, mamma, not conquer this, and live it down!&rsquo; cried Sophy; but then
      changing, she sighed and said, &lsquo;If he would&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, a great deal depends upon how he may take this, and what becomes of
      Algernon Dusautoy; though I suppose there is no lack of other tempters.
      Your papa has even spoken of India again; he still thinks he would be more
      guarded there, but all depends on the spirit in which we find him. One
      thing I hope, that I shall leave it all to his father&rsquo;s judgment, and not
      say one word.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The next post brought a penitent letter from Gilbert, submitting
      completely to his father; only begging that he might not see any one at
      home until he should have redeemed his character, and promising to work
      very hard and deny himself all relaxation if he might only go to a tutor
      at a distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      This did not at all accord with Mr. Kendal&rsquo;s views. He had an unavowed
      distrust of Gilbert&rsquo;s letters, he did not fancy a tutor thus selected, and
      believed the boy to be physically incapable of the proposed amount of
      study. So he wrote a very grave but merciful summons to Willow Lawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia went to meet the delinquent at Hadminster, and was struck by the
      different deportment of the two youths. Algernon Dusautoy, whose servant
      had met him, sauntered up to her as if nothing had happened, carelessly
      hoped all were well at Bayford, and, in spite of her exceeding coldness,
      talked on with perfect ease upon the chances of a war with Russia, and had
      given her three or four maxims, before Gilbert came up with the luggage
      van, with a bag in his hand, and a hurried bewildered manner, unable to
      meet her eye. He handed her into the carriage, seated himself beside her,
      and drove off without one unnecessary word, while Algernon, mounting his
      horse, waved them a disengaged farewell, and cantered on. Albinia heard a
      heavy sigh, and saw her companion very wan and sorrowful, dejection in
      every feature, in the whole stoop of his figure, and in the nervous twitch
      of his hands. The contrast gave an additional impulse to her love and
      pity, and the first words she said were, &lsquo;Your father is quite ready to
      forgive.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I knew he would be so,&rsquo; he answered, hardly able to command his voice; &lsquo;I
      knew you would all be a great deal too kind to me, and that is the worst
      of all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, Gilbert, not if it gives you resolution to resist the next time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He groaned; and it was not long before she drew from him a sincere avowal
      of his follies and repentance. He had been led on by assurances that
      &lsquo;every one&rsquo; did the like, by fear of betraying his own timidity, by absurd
      dread of being disdained as slow; all this working on his natural
      indolence and love of excitement, had combined to involve him in habits
      which had brought on him this disgrace. It was a hopeful sign that he
      admitted its justice, and accused no one of partiality; the reprimand had
      told upon him, and he was too completely struck down even to attempt to
      justify himself; exceedingly afraid of his father, and only longing to
      hide himself. Such was his utter despair, that Albinia had no scruples in
      encouraging him, and assuring him with all her heart, that if taken
      rightly, the shock that brought him to his senses, might be the blessing
      of his life. He did not take comfort readily, though soothed by her
      kindness; he could not get over his excessive dread of his father, and
      each attempt at reassurance fell short. At last it came out that the very
      core of his misery was this, that he had found himself for part of the
      journey, in the same train with Miss Durant and two or three children. He
      could not tell her where he was going nor why, and he had leant back in
      the carriage, and watched her on the platform by stealth, as she moved
      about, &lsquo;lovelier and more graceful than ever!&rsquo; but how could he present
      himself to her in his disgrace and misery? &lsquo;Oh, Mrs. Kendal, I forgive my
      father, but my life was blighted when I was cut off from her!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, Gilbert, you are wrong. There is no blighting in a worthy,
      disinterested attachment. To be able to love and respect such a woman is a
      good substantial quality in you, and ought to make you a higher and better
      man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert turned round a face of extreme amazement. &lsquo;I thought,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I
      thought you&mdash;&rsquo; and went no farther.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I respect your feeling for her more than when it was two years younger,&rsquo; 
      she said; &lsquo;I should respect it doubly if instead of making you ashamed, it
      had saved you from the need of shame.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you give me any hope?&rsquo; cried Gilbert, his face gleaming into sudden
      eager brightness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Things have not become more suitable,&rsquo; said Albinia; and his look lapsed
      again into despondency; but she added, &lsquo;Each step towards real manhood,
      force of character, and steadiness, would give you weight which might make
      your choice worth your father&rsquo;s consideration, and you worth that of
      Genevieve.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! would you but have told me so before!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was evident to your own senses,&rsquo; said Albinia; and she thought of the
      suggestion that Sophy had made.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Too late! too late!&rsquo; sighed Gilbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, never too late! You have had a warning; you are very young, and it
      cannot be too late for winning a character, and redeeming the time!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you tell me I may love her!&rsquo; repeated Gilbert, so intoxicated with
      the words, that she became afraid of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do not tell you that you may importune her, or disobey your father. I
      only tell you that to look up and work and deny yourself, in honour of one
      so truly noble, is one of the best and most saving of secondary motives. I
      shall honour you, Gilbert, if you do so use it as to raise and support
      you, though of course I cannot promise that she can be earned by it, and
      even that motive will not do alone, however powerful you may think it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither of them said more, but Gilbert sighed heavily several times, and
      would willingly have checked their homeward speed. He grew pale as they
      entered the town, and groaned as the gates swung back, and they rattled
      over the wooden bridge. It was about four o&rsquo;clock, and he said, hurriedly,
      as with a sort of hope, &lsquo;I suppose they are all out.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He was answered by a whoop of ecstasy, and before he was well out of the
      carriage, he was seized by the joyous Maurice, shouting that he had been
      for a ride with papa, without a leading rein. Happy age for both, too
      young to know more than that the beloved playfellow was at home again!
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Albinia studied her brother till the small memory came back, and
      she made her pretty signs for the well-remembered dancing in his arms.
      From such greetings, Gilbert&rsquo;s wounded spirit could not shrink, much as he
      dreaded all others; and, carrying the baby and preceded by Maurice, while
      he again muttered that of course no one was at home, he went upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia meantime tapped at the library door. She knew Mr. Kendal to be
      there, yearning to forgive, but thinking it right to have his pardon
      sought; and she went in to tell him of his son&rsquo;s keen remorse, and deadly
      fear. Displeased and mournful, Mr. Kendal sighed. &lsquo;He has little to fear
      from me, would he but believe so! He ought to have come to me, but&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      That &lsquo;but&rsquo; meant repentance for over-sternness in times past.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let me send him to you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will come,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal, willing to spare his son the terror of
      presenting himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pretty sight in the morning-room. Gilbert was on the floor
      with the two children, Maurice intent on showing how nearly little Albinia
      could run alone, and between ordering and coaxing, drawing her gently on;
      her beautiful brown eyes opened very seriously to the great undertaking,
      and her round soft hands, with a mixture of confidence and timidity,
      trusted within the sturdy ones of her small elder, while Gilbert knelt on
      one knee, and stretched out a protecting arm, really to grasp the little
      one, if the more childish brother should fail her, and his countenance,
      lighted up with interest and affection, was far more prepossessing than
      when so lately it had been, full of cowering, almost abject apprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it a sort of instinctive feeling that the little sister would be his
      best shelter, that made him gather the child into his arms, and hold her
      before his deeply blushing face as he rose from the floor? She merrily
      called out, &lsquo;Papa!&rsquo; Maurice loudly began to recount her exploits, and thus
      passed the salutation, at the end of which Gilbert found that his father
      was taking the little one from him, and giving her to her mother, who
      carried her away, calling Maurice with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you nothing to say to me?&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal, after waiting for some
      moments; but as Gilbert only looked up to him with a piteous, scared,
      uncertain glance, be added; &lsquo;You need not fear me; I believe you have
      erred more from weakness than from evil inclinations, and I trust in the
      sincerity of your repentance.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      These kind words softened Gilbert; he assured his father of his thanks for
      his kindness, no one could grieve more deeply, or be more anxious to atone
      in any possible manner for what he had unwittingly done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I believe you, Gilbert,&rsquo; said his father; &lsquo;but you well know that the
      only way of atoning for the past, as well as of avoiding such wretchedness
      and disgrace for the future, is to show greater firmness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know it is,&rsquo; said Gilbert, sorrowfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I cannot look into your heart,&rsquo; added Mr. Kendal. &lsquo;I can only hope and
      believe that your grief for the sin is as deep, or deeper, than that for
      the public stigma, for which comparatively, I care little.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert exclaimed that so indeed it was, and this was no more than the
      truth. Out of sight of temptation, and in that pure atmosphere, the loud
      revel and coarse witticisms that had led him on, were only loathsome and
      disgusting, and made him miserable in the recollection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am ready to submit to anything,&rsquo; he added, fervently. &lsquo;As long as you
      forgive me, I am ready to bear anything.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I forgive you from my heart,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal, warmly. &lsquo;I only wish to
      consider what may be most expedient for you. I should scarcely like to
      send you back to Oxford to retrieve your character, unless I were sure
      that you would be more resolute in resisting temptation. No, do not reply;
      your actions during this time of penance will be a far more satisfactory
      answer than any promises. I had thought of again applying to your cousin
      John, to take you into his bank, though you could not now go on such terms
      as you might have done when there was no error in the background, and I
      still sometimes question whether it be not the safer method.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Whatever you please,&rsquo; said Gilbert; &lsquo;I deserve it all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nay, do not look upon my decision, whatever it may be, as punishment, but
      only as springing from my desire for your real welfare. I will write to
      your cousin and ask whether he still has a vacancy, but without absolutely
      proposing you to him, and we will look on the coming months as a period of
      probation, during which we may judge what may be the wisest course. I will
      only ask one other question, Gilbert, and you need not be afraid to answer
      me fully and freely. Have you any debts at Oxford?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A few,&rsquo; stammered Gilbert, with a great effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can you tell me to whom, and the amount?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He tried to recollect as well as he could, while completely frightened and
      confused by the gravity with which his father was jotting them down in his
      pocket-book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, Gilbert,&rsquo; he concluded, &lsquo;you have dealt candidly with me, and you
      shall never have cause to regret having done so. And now we will only feel
      that you are at home, and dwell no longer on the cause that has brought
      you. Come out, and see what we have been doing in the meadow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert seemed more overthrown and broken down by kindness than by
      reproof. He hardly exerted himself even to play with Maurice, or to amuse
      his grandmother; and though his sisters treated him as usual, he never
      once lifted up his eyes to meet Sophy&rsquo;s glance, and scarcely used his
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing could be more disarming than such genuine sorrow; and Sophy,
      pardoning him with all her heart, and mourning for her past want of
      charity, watched him, longing to do something for his comfort, and to
      evince her tenderness; but only succeeded in encumbering every petty
      service or word of intercourse with a weight of sad consciousness.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I had almost written to ask your pardon,&rsquo; said Mrs. Dusautoy, as Albinia
      entered her drawing-room on the afternoon following. &lsquo;I should like by way
      of experiment to know what <i>would</i> put that boy out of countenance.
      He listened with placid graciousness to his uncle&rsquo;s lecture, and then gave
      us to understand that he was obliged for his solicitude, and that there
      was a great deal of jealousy and misrepresentation at Oxford; but he
      thought it best always to submit to authorities, however unreasonable. And
      this morning, after amiably paying his respects to me, he said he was
      going to inquire for Gilbert. I intimated that Willow Lawn was the last
      place where he would be welcome, but he was far above attending to me. Did
      Gilbert see him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gilbert was in the garden with us when we were told he was in the house.
      Poor fellow, he shuddered, and looked as if he wanted me to guard him, so
      I sent him out walking with Maurice while I went in, and found Lucy
      entertaining the gentleman. I made myself as cold and inhospitable as I
      could, but I am afraid he rather relishes a dignified retenue.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor boy! I wonder what on earth is to be done with him. I never before
      knew what John&rsquo;s love and patience were.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you think he will remain here?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I cannot tell; we talk of tutors, but John is really, I believe, happier
      for having him here, and besides one can be sure the worst he is doing is
      painting a lobster. However, much would depend on what you and Mr. Kendal
      thought. If he and Gilbert were doing harm to each other, everything must
      give way.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If people of that age will not keep themselves out of harm&rsquo;s way, nobody
      can do it for them,&rsquo; said Albinia, &lsquo;and as long as Gilbert continues in
      his present mood, there is more real separation in voluntarily holding
      aloof, than if they were sent far apart, only to come together again at
      college.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert did continue in the same mood. The tender cherishing of his home
      restored his spirits; but he was much subdued, and deeply grateful, as he
      manifested by the most eager and affectionate courtesy, such as made him
      almost the servant of everybody, without any personal aim or object,
      except to work up his deficient studies, and to avoid young Dusautoy. He
      seemed to cling to his family as his protectors, and to follow the
      occupations least likely to lead to a meeting with the Polysyllable; he
      was often at church in the week, rode with his father, went parish
      visiting with the ladies, and was responsible when Maurice fished for
      minnows in the meadows. Nothing could be more sincerely desirous to atone
      for the past and enter on a different course, and no conduct could be more
      truly humble or endearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The imaginary disdain of Ulick O&rsquo;More was entirely gone, and perceiving
      that the Irishman&rsquo;s delicacy was keeping him away from Willow Lawn,
      Gilbert himself met him and brought him home, in the delight of having
      heard of a naval cadetship having been offered to his brother, and full of
      such eager joy as longed for sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Happy fellow!&rsquo; Gilbert murmured to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Younger in years, more childish in character, poor Gilbert had managed to
      make his spirit world-worn and weary, compared with the fresh manly heart
      of the Irishman, all centered in the kindred &lsquo;points of Heaven and home,&rsquo; 
      and enjoying keenly, for the very reason that he bent dutifully with all
      his might to a humble and uncongenial task.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet somehow, admire and esteem as he would, there arose no intimacy or
      friendship between Gilbert and Ulick; their manners were frank and easy,
      but there was no spontaneous approach, no real congeniality, nor exchange
      of mind and sympathy as between Ulick and Mr. Kendal. Albinia had a theory
      that the friendship was too much watched to take; Sophy hated herself for
      the recurring conviction that &lsquo;Gilbert was not the kind of stuff,&rsquo; though
      she felt day by day how far he excelled her in humility, gentleness, and
      sweet temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Goldsmiths gave their annual dinner-party, Albinia felt a sudden
      glow at the unexpected sight of Ulick O&rsquo;More.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am only deputy for the Orange man,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;it is Hyder Ali who ought
      to be dining here! Yes, it is his doing, I&rsquo;d back him against any
      detective!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What heroism have you been acting together?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We had just given Farmer Martin L120 in notes, when as he went out, we
      heard little Hyder growling and giving tongue, and a fellow swearing as if
      he was at the fair of Monyveagh, and the farmer hallooing thieves. I found
      little Hyder had nailed the rascal fast by the leg, just as he had the
      notes out of the farmer&rsquo;s pouch. I collared him, Johns ran for the police,
      and the rascal is fast.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a shame to cheat Mr. Kendal of the committal.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The policeman said he was gone out, so we had the villain up to the
      Admiral with the greater satisfaction, as he was a lodger in one of the
      Admiral&rsquo;s pet public-houses in Tibb&rsquo;s Alley.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, when Gilbert is of age,&rsquo; said Albinia, &lsquo;woe to Tibb&rsquo;s! So you are a
      testimonial to the Tripod?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So I suspect, for I found an invitation when I came home, I would have
      run down to tell you, but I had been kept late, and one takes some getting
      up for polite society.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a great deal of talk about Hyder&rsquo;s exploit, and some disposition
      to make Mr. O&rsquo;More the hero of the day; but this was quickly nipped by his
      uncle&rsquo;s dry shortness, and the superciliousness with which Mr. Cavendish
      Dusautoy turned the conversation to the provision of pistols, couriers,
      and guards, for travelling through the Abruzzi. The polysyllabic courage,
      and false alarms on such a scale, completely eclipsed a real pick-pocket,
      caught by a gipsy&rsquo;s cur and a banker&rsquo;s clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not that Ulick perceived any disregard until later in the evening, when
      the young Kendals arrived, and of course he wanted each and all to hear of
      his Tripod&rsquo;s achievement. He met with ready attention from Sophy and
      Gilbert, who pronounced that as the cat was to Whittington, so was Hyder
      to O&rsquo;More; but when in his overflowing he proceeded to Lucy, she had
      neither eyes nor ears for him, and when the vicar told her Mr. O&rsquo;More was
      speaking to her, she turned with an air of petulance, so that he felt
      obliged to beg her pardon and retreat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bayford parties never lasted later than a few minutes after ten, but
      when once Mr. Cavendish Dusautoy and Miss Kendal had possession of the
      piano and guitar, there was no conclusion. Song succeeded song, they
      wanted nothing save their own harmony, and hardly waited for Miss
      Goldsmith&rsquo;s sleepy thanks. The vicar hated late hours, and the Kendals
      felt every song a trespass upon their hosts, but the musicians had their
      backs to the world, and gave no interval, so that it was eleven o&rsquo;clock
      before Mr. Kendal, in desperation, laid his hand on his daughter, and
      barbarously carried her off.
    </p>
    <p>
      The flirtation was so palpable, that Albinia mused on the means of
      repressing it; but she believed that to remonstrate, would only be to give
      Lucy pleasure, and held her peace till a passion for riding seized upon
      the young lady. The old pony had hard service between Sophy&rsquo;s needs and
      Maurice&rsquo;s exactions, but Lucy&rsquo;s soul soared far above ponies, and fastened
      upon Gilbert&rsquo;s steed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And pray what is Gilbert to ride?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! papa does not always want Captain, or Mr. Cavendish Dusautoy would
      lend him Bamfylde.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; returned Gilbert, satirically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning Lucy, radiant with smiles, announced that all was settled.
      Mr. Cavendish Dusautoy&rsquo;s Lady Elmira would be brought down for her to try
      this afternoon, so Gilbert might keep his own horse and come too, which
      permission he received with a long whistle and glance at Mrs. Kendal, and
      then walked out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How disobliging!&rsquo; said Lucy. &lsquo;Well then, Sophy, you must make your old
      hat look as well as you can, for I suppose it will not quite do to go
      without anyone.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy, like her brother, looked at Mrs. Kendal, and with an eye of
      indignant appeal and entreaty, while Albinia&rsquo;s countenance was so full of
      displeasure, that Lucy continued earnestly, &lsquo;O, mamma, you can&rsquo;t object.
      You used to go out riding with papa when he was at Colonel Bury&rsquo;s.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, Lucy!&rsquo; exclaimed her sister, &lsquo;I did not think even you capable of
      such a comparison.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s all the same,&rsquo; said Lucy tartly, blushing a good deal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy leapt up to look at her, and Albinia trying to be calm and
      judicious, demanded, &lsquo;What is the same as what?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, Algernon and <i>me</i>,&rsquo; was the equally precise reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      In stately horror, Sophy rose and seriously marched away, leaving, by her
      look and manner, a species of awe upon both parties, and some seconds
      passed ere, with crimson blushes, Albania ventured to invite the dreaded
      admission, by demanding, &lsquo;Now, Lucy, will you be so good as to tell me the
      meaning of this extraordinary allusion?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, to be sure&mdash;I know it was very different. Papa was so old, and
      <i>there were us</i>,&rsquo; faltered Lucy, &lsquo;but I meant, you would know how it
      all is&mdash;how those things&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stop, Lucy, am I to understand by those things, that you wish me to
      believe you and Mr. Cavendish Dusautoy are on the game terms as&mdash;No,
      I can&rsquo;t say it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean,&rsquo; said Lucy, growing frightened, &lsquo;I never
      thought there could be such an uproar about my just going out riding.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have led me to infer so much more, that it becomes my duty to have an
      explanation, at least,&rsquo; she added, thinking this sounded cold, &lsquo;I should
      have hoped you would have given me your confidence.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O, but you always would make game of him!&rsquo; cried Lucy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not now; this is much too serious, if you have been led to believe that
      his attentions are not as I supposed, because you are the only girl about
      here whom he thinks worthy of his notice.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a great deal more,&rsquo; said Lucy, with more feeling and less vanity
      than had yet been apparent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what has he been making you think, my poor child?&rsquo; said Albinia. &lsquo;I
      know it is very distressing, but it would be more right and safe if I knew
      what it amounts to.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not much after all,&rsquo; said Lucy, her tone implying the reverse, and though
      her cheeks were crimson, not averse to the triumph of the avowal, nor
      enduring as much embarrassment as her auditor, &lsquo;only he made me sure of it&mdash;he
      said&mdash;(now, mamma, you have made me, so I must) that he had changed
      his opinion of English beauty&mdash;you know, mamma. And another time he
      said he had wandered Europe over to&mdash;to find loveliness on the banks
      of the Baye. Wasn&rsquo;t it absurd? And he says he does not think it half so
      much that a woman should be accomplished herself, as that she should be
      able to appreciate other people&rsquo;s talents&mdash;and once he said the
      Principessa Bianca di Moretti would be very much disappointed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, my dear,&rsquo; said Albinia, kindly putting her arm round Lucy&rsquo;s waist,
      &lsquo;perhaps by themselves the things did not so much require to be told. I
      can hardly blame you, and I wish I had been more on my guard, and helped
      you more. Only if he seems to care so little about disappointing this lady
      might he not do the same by you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But she&rsquo;s an Italian, and a Roman Catholic,&rsquo; exclaimed Lucy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia could not help smiling, and Lucy, perceiving that this was hardly
      a valid excuse for her utter indifference towards her Grandison&rsquo;s
      Clementina, continued, &lsquo;I mean&mdash;of course there was nothing in it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very possibly; but how would it be, if by-and-by he told somebody that
      Miss Kendal would be very much disappointed?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O, mamma,&rsquo; cried Lucy, hastily detaching herself, &lsquo;you don&rsquo;t know!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I cannot tell, my poor Lucy,&rsquo; said Albinia. &lsquo;I fear there must be grief
      and trouble any way, if you let yourself attend to him, for you know, even
      if he were in earnest, it would not be right to think of a person who has
      shown so little wish to be good.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy stood for a few moments before the sense reached her mind, then she
      dropped into a chair, and exclaimed,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I see how it is! You&rsquo;ll treat him as grandpapa treated Captain Pringle,
      but I shall break my heart, quite!&rsquo; and she burst into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear, your father and I will do our best for your happiness, and we
      would never use concealment. Whatever we do shall be as Christian people
      working together, not as tyrants with a silly girl.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy was pleased, and let Albinia take her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then I will write to decline the horse. It would be far too marked.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But oh, mamma! you wont keep him away!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall not alter our habits unless I see cause. He is much too young for
      us to think seriously of what he may have said; and I entreat you to put
      it out of your mind, for it would be very sad for you to fix your thoughts
      on him, and then find him not in earnest, and even if he were, you know it
      would be wrong to let affection grow up where there is no real dependence
      upon a person&rsquo;s goodness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The kindness soothed Lucy, and though she shed some tears, she did not
      resist the decision. Indeed she was sensible of that calm determination of
      manner, which all the family had learnt to mean that the measures thus
      taken were unalterable, whereas the impetuous impulses often were
      reversed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many a woman&rsquo;s will is like the tide, ever fretting at the verge of the
      boundary, but afraid to overpass it, and only tempting the utmost limit in
      the certainty of the recall, and Lucy perhaps felt a kind of protection in
      the curb, even while she treated it as an injury. She liked to be the
      object of solicitude, and was pleased with Albinia&rsquo;s extra kindness,
      while, perhaps, there was some excitement in the belief that Algernon was
      missing her, so she was particularly amenable, and not much out of
      spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      The original Meadows character, and Bayford breeding, had for a time been
      surmounted by Albinia&rsquo;s influence and training; but so ingrain was the old
      disposition, that a touch would at once re-awaken it, and the poor girl
      was in a neutral state, coloured by whichever impression had been most
      recent. Albinia&rsquo;s hopes of prevailing in the end increased when Mrs.
      Dusautoy told her, with a look of intelligence, that Algernon was going to
      stay with a connexion of his mother, a Mr. Greenaway, with six daughters,
      very stylish young ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Six stylish young ladies! Albinia could have embraced them all, and
      actually conferred a cordial nod on Mr. Cavendish Dusautoy when she met
      him on the way home.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as she entered the house, so ominous a tone summoned her to the
      library, that she needed not to be told that Mr. Cavendish Dusautoy had
      been there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I told him,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal, &lsquo;that he was too young for me to entertain
      his proposal, and I intimated that he had character to redeem before
      presenting himself in such capacity.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope you made the refusal evident to his intellect.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He drove me to be more explicit than I intended. I think he was
      astonished. He stared at me for full three minutes before he could believe
      in the refusal. Poor lad, it must be real attachment, there could be no
      other inducement.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And Lucy is exceedingly pretty.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kendal glanced at the portrait over the mantelpiece smiled sadly, and
      shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor dear,&rsquo; continued Albinia, &lsquo;what a commotion there will be in her
      head; but she has behaved so well hitherto, that I hope we may steer her
      safely through, above all, if one of the six cousins will but catch him in
      the rebound! Have you spoken to her?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it necessary?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So asked her grandfather,&rsquo; said Albinia, smiling, as he, a little out of
      countenance, muttered something of &lsquo;foolish affair&mdash;mere child&mdash;and
      turn her head&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s done!&rsquo; said Albinia, &lsquo;we have only to try to get it straight.
      Besides, it would hardly be just to let her think he had meant nothing,
      and I have promised to deal openly with her, otherwise we can hardly hope
      for plain dealing from her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you think it will be a serious disappointment?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She is highly flattered by his attention, but I don&rsquo;t know how deep it
      may have gone.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish people would let one&rsquo;s daughters alone!&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Kendal.
      &lsquo;You will talk to her then, Albinia, and don&rsquo;t let her think me more harsh
      than you can help, and come and tell me how she bears it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Won&rsquo;t you speak to her yourself?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you think I must?&rsquo; he said, reluctantly; &lsquo;you know so much better how
      to manage her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think you must do this, dear Edmund,&rsquo; she said, between decision and
      entreaty. &lsquo;She knows that I dislike the man, and may fancy it my doing it
      she only hears it at second hand. If you speak, there will be no appeal,
      and besides there are moments when the really nearest should have no
      go-betweens.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We were not very near without you,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;If it were Sophy, I should
      know better what to be about.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sophy would not put you in such a fix.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So I have fancied&mdash;&rsquo; he paused, smiling, while she waited in eager
      curiosity, such as made him finish as if ashamed. &lsquo;I have thought our
      likings much the same. Have you never observed what I mean?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! I never observe anything. I did not find out Maurice and Winifred
      till he told me. Who do you think it is? I always thought love would be
      the making of Sophy. I see she is another being. What is your guess, Mr.
      Hope?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kendal made a face of astonishment at such an improbable guess, and
      was driven into exclaiming, &lsquo;How could any one help thinking of O&rsquo;More?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! only too delightful!&rsquo; cried Albinia. &lsquo;Why didn&rsquo;t I think of it&mdash;but
      then his way is so free and cousinly with us all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There may be nothing in it,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal; &lsquo;and under present
      circumstances it would hardly be desirable.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If old Mr. Goldsmith acts as he ought,&rsquo; continued Albinia, &lsquo;we should
      never lose our Sophy&mdash;and what a son we should have! he has so
      exactly the bright temper that she needs.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, well, that is all in the clouds,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal. &lsquo;I wish the
      present were equally satisfactory.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, I had better call poor Lucy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come back with her, pray,&rsquo; called Mr. Kendal, nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia regretted her superfluous gossip when Lucy appeared with eyes so
      sparkling, and cheeks so flushed, that it was plain that she had been in
      all the miseries of suspense. Her countenance glowed with feeling, that
      lifted her beyond her ordinary doll-like prettiness. Albinia&rsquo;s heart sank
      with compassion as she held her hand, and her father stood as if struck by
      something more like the vision or his youth than he had been prepared for;
      each feeling that something genuine was present, and respecting it
      accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lucy,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal, tenderly, &lsquo;I see I need not tell you why I have
      sent for you. You are very young, my dear, and you must trust us to care
      for your happiness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; Lucy looked up wistfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This gentleman has some qualities such as may make him shine in the eyes
      of a young lady; but it is our duty to look farther, and I am afraid I
      know nothing of him that could justify me in trusting him with anything so
      precious to me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy&rsquo;s face became full of consternation, her hand lay unnerved in
      Albinia&rsquo;a pressure, and Mr. Kendal turned his eyes from her to his wife,
      as he proceeded,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have seen so much wretchedness caused by want of religious principle,
      that even where the morals appeared unblemished, I should feel no
      confidence where I saw no evidence of religion, and I should consider it
      as positively wrong to sanction an engagement with such a person. Now you
      must perceive that we have every means of forming an opinion of this young
      man, and that he has given us no reason to think he would show the
      unselfish care for your welfare that we should wish to secure.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia tried to make it comprehensible. &lsquo;You know, my dear, we have
      always seen him resolved on his own way, and not caring how he may
      inconvenience his uncle and aunt. We know his temper is not always
      amiable, and differently as you see him, you must let us judge.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Wrenching her hand away, Lucy burst into tears. Her father looked at
      Albinia, as if she ought to have saved him this infliction, and she began
      a little whispering about not distressing papa, which checked the sobs,
      and enabled him to say, &lsquo;There, that&rsquo;s right, my dear, I see you are
      willing to submit patiently to our judgment, and I believe you will find
      it for the best. We will do all in our power to help you, and make you
      happy,&rsquo; and bending down he kissed her, and left her to his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      In such family scenes, logic is less useful than the power of coming to a
      friendly conclusion; Lucy&rsquo;s awe of her father was a great assistance, she
      was touched with his unwonted softness, and did not apprehend how total
      was the rejection. But what he was spared, was reserved for Albinia. There
      was a lamentable scene of sobbing and weeping, beyond all argument, and
      only ending in physical exhaustion, which laid her on the bed all the rest
      of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert and Sophy could not but be aware of the cause of her distress. The
      former thought it a great waste.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tell Lucy,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;that if she wishes to be miserable for life, she
      has found the best way! He is a thorough-bred tyrant at heart, pig-headed,
      and obstinate, and with the very worst temper I ever came across. Not a
      soul can he feel for, nor admire but himself. His wife will be a perfect
      slave. I declare I would as soon sell her to Legree.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy&rsquo;s views of the gentleman were not more favourable, but she was in
      terror lest Lucy should have a permanently broken heart, after the
      precedent of Aunt Maria. And on poor Sophy fell the misfortune of being
      driven up by grandmamma&rsquo;s inquiries, to own that the proposal had been
      rejected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shade of poor dear Mr. Meadows, didst thou not stand aghast! Five thousand
      a year refused! Grandmamma would have had a fit if she had not conceived a
      conviction, that imparted a look of shrewdness to her mild, simple old
      face. Of course Mr. Kendal was only holding off till the young man was a
      little older. He could have no intention of letting his daughter miss such
      a match, and dear Lucy would have her carriage, and be presented at court.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy argued vehemently against this, and poor grandmamma, who had with
      difficulty been taught worldly wisdom as a duty, and always thought
      herself good when she talked prudently, began to cry. Sophy, quite
      overcome, was equally distressing with her apologies; Albinia found them
      both in tears, and Sophy was placed on the sick-list by one of her
      peculiar headaches of self-reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a time of great perplexity. Lucy cried incessantly, bursting out at
      every trifle, but making no complaints, and submitting so meekly, that the
      others were almost as unhappy as herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was first cheered by the long promised visit from Mrs. Annesley and
      Miss Ferrars. Albinia had now no fears of showing off home or children,
      and it was a great success.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little Awk was in high beauty, and graciously winning, and Maurice&rsquo;s
      likeness to his Uncle William enchanted the aunts, though they were
      shocked at his mamma&rsquo;s indifference to his constant imperilling of life
      and limb, and grievously discomfited his sisters by adducing children who
      talked French and read history, whereas he could not read d-o-g without
      spelling, and had peculiar views as to b and d, p and q. However, if he
      could not read he could ride, and Mrs. Annesley scarcely knew the extent
      of the favour she conferred, when she commissioned Gilbert to procure for
      him a pony as his private property.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Ferrars had not expected one of the thirty-six O&rsquo;Mores to turn up
      here. She gave some good advice about hasty intimacies, and as it was
      received with a defence of the gentility of the O&rsquo;Mores, the two good
      ladies agreed that dear Albinia was quite a child still, not fit for the
      care of those girls, and it would be only acting kindly to take Lucy to
      Brighton, and show her something of the world, or Albinia would surely let
      her fall a prey to that Irish clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      They liked Lucy&rsquo;s pretty face and obliging ways, and were fond of having a
      young lady in their house; they saw her looking ill and depressed, and
      thought sea air would be good for her, and though Lucy fancied herself
      past caring for gaiety, and was very sorry to leave home and mamma, she
      was not insensible to the refreshment of her wardrobe, and the excitement
      and honour of the invitation. At night she cried lamentably, and clung
      round Albinia&rsquo;a neck, sobbing, &lsquo;Oh, mamma, what will become of me without
      you?&rsquo; but in the morning she went off in very fair spirits, and Albinia
      augured hopefully that soon her type of perfection would be no longer
      Polysyllabic. Her first letters were deplorable, but they soon became
      cheerful, as her mornings were occupied by lessons in music and drawing,
      and her evenings in quiet parties among the friends whom the aunts met at
      Brighton. Aunt Gertrude wrote to announce that her charge had recovered
      her looks and was much admired, and this was corroborated by the
      prosperous complacency of Lucy&rsquo;s style. Albinia was more relieved than
      surprised when the letters dwindled in length and number, well knowing
      that the Family Office was not favourable to leisure; and devoid of the
      epistolary gift herself, she always wondered more at people&rsquo;s writing than
      at their silence, and scarcely reciprocated Lucy&rsquo;s effusions by the
      hurried notes which she enclosed in the well-filled envelopes of Gilbert
      and Sophy, who, like their father, could cover any amount of sheets of
      paper.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There!&rsquo; cried Ulick O&rsquo;More, &lsquo;I may wish you all good-bye. There&rsquo;s an end
      of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kendal stood aghast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s insulted my father and my family,&rsquo; cried Ulick, &lsquo;and does he think
      I&rsquo;ll write another cipher for him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your uncle?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t call him my uncle. I wish I&rsquo;d never set eyes on his wooden old
      face, to put the family name and honour in the power of such as he.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What has he done to you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He has offered to take me as his partner,&rsquo; cried Ulick, with flashing
      eyes; and as an outcry arose, not in sympathy with his resentment, he
      continued vehemently, &lsquo;Stay, you have not heard! &lsquo;Twas on condition I&rsquo;d
      alter my name, leave out the O that has come down to me from them that
      were kings and princes before his grandfathers broke stones on the road.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He offered to take you into partnership,&rsquo; repeated Mr. Kendal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you think I could listen to such terms!&rsquo; cried the indignant lad.
      &lsquo;Give up the O! Why, I would never be able to face my brothers!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But, Ulick&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t talk to me, Mr. Kendal; I wouldn&rsquo;t sell my name if you were to
      argue to me like Plato, nor if his bank were the Bank of England. I might
      as well be an Englishman at once.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then this was the insult?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And enough too, but it wasn&rsquo;t all. When I answered, speaking as coolly, I
      assure you, as I&rsquo;m doing this minute, what does he do, but call it a
      folly, and taunt us for a crew of Irish beggars! Beggars we may be, but
      we&rsquo;ll not be bought by him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, this must have been an unexpected reception of such a proposal.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You may say that! The English think everything may be bought with money!
      I&rsquo;d have overlooked his ignorance, poor old gentleman, if he would not
      have gone and spoken of my O as vulgar. Vulgar! So when I began to tell
      him how it began from Tigearnach, the O&rsquo;More of Ballymakilty, that was
      Tanist of Connaught, in the time of King Mac Murrough, and that killed
      Phadrig the O&rsquo;Donoghoe in single combat at the fight of Shoch-knockmorty,
      and bit off his nose, calling it a sweet morsel of revenge, what does he
      do but tell me I was mad, and that he would have none of my nonsensical
      tales of the savage Irish. So I said I couldn&rsquo;t stand to hear my family
      insulted, and then&mdash;would you believe it? he would have it that it
      was I that was insolent, and when I was not going to apologize for what I
      had borne from him, he said he had always known how it would be trying to
      deal with one of our family, no better than making a silk purse out of a
      sow&rsquo;s ear. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m obliged for the compliment,&rdquo; said I, quite coolly and
      politely, &ldquo;but no Irish pig would sell his ear for a purse;&rdquo; and so I came
      away, quite civilly and reasonably. Aye, I see what you would do, Mr.
      Kendal, but I beg with all my heart you won&rsquo;t. There are some things a
      gentleman should not put up with, and I&rsquo;ll not take it well of you if you
      call it my duty to hear my father and his family abused. I&rsquo;ll despise
      myself if I could. <i>You</i> don&rsquo;t&mdash;&rsquo; cried he, turning round to
      Albinia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, no, but I think you should try to understand Mr. Goldsmith&rsquo;s point of
      view.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I understand it only too well, if that would do any good. Point of view&mdash;why,
      &lsquo;tis the farmyard cock&rsquo;s point of view, strutting on the top of that bank
      of his own, and patronizing the free pheasant out in the woods. More fool
      I for ever letting him clip my wings, but he&rsquo;s seen the last of me. No,
      don&rsquo;t ask me to make it up. It can&rsquo;t be done&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What can be done to the boy?&rsquo; asked Albinia; &lsquo;how can he be brought to
      hear reason?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Leave him alone,&rsquo; Mr. Kendal said, aside; while Ulick in a torrent of
      eager cadences protested his perfect sanity and reason, and Mr. Kendal
      quietly left the room, again to start on a peace-making mission, but it
      was unpromising, for Mr. Goldsmith began by declaring he would not hear a
      single word in favour of the ungrateful young dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kendal gathered that young O&rsquo;More had become so valuable, and that
      cold and indifferent as Mr. Goldsmith appeared, he had been growing so
      fond and so proud of his nephew, as actually to resolve on giving him a
      share of the business, and dividing the inheritance which had hitherto
      been destined to a certain Andrew Goldsmith, brought up in a relation&rsquo;s
      office at Bristol. Surprised at his own graciousness, and anticipating
      transports of gratitude, his dismay and indignation at the reception of
      his proposal were extreme, especially as he had no conception of the
      offence he had given regarding the unfortunate O as a badge of
      Hibernianism and vulgarity. &lsquo;I put it to you, Mr. Kendal, as a sensible
      man, whether it would not be enough to destroy the credit of the bank to
      connect it with such a name as that, looking like an Irish haymaker&rsquo;s. I
      should be ashamed of every note I issued.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is unlucky,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal, &lsquo;and a difficulty the lad could hardly
      appreciate, since it is a good old name, and the O is a special mark of
      nobility.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what has a banker to do with nobility? Pretty sort of nobility too,
      at that dog-kennel of theirs in Ireland, and his father, a mere adventurer
      if ever there lived one! But I swore when he carried off poor Ellen that
      his speculation should do him no good, and I&rsquo;ve kept my word. I wish I
      hadn&rsquo;t been fool enough to meddle with one of the concern! No, no, &lsquo;tis no
      use arguing, Mr. Kendal, I have done with him! I would not make him a
      partner, not if he offered to change his name to John Smith! I never
      thought to meet with such ingratitude, but it runs in the breed! I might
      have known better than to make much of one of the crew. Yet it is a pity
      too, we have not had such a clear-headed, trustworthy fellow about the
      place since young Bowles died; he has a good deal of the Goldsmith in him
      when you set him to work, and makes his figures just like my poor father.
      I thought it was his writing the other day till I looked at the date.
      Clever lad, very, but it runs in the blood. I shall send for Andrew
      Goldsmith.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      One secret of Mr. Kendal&rsquo;s power was that he never interrupted, but let
      people run themselves down and contradict themselves; and all he observed
      was, &lsquo;However it may end, you have done a great deal for him. Even if you
      parted now, he would be able to find a situation.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why&mdash;yes,&rsquo; said Mr. Goldsmith, &lsquo;the lad knew nothing serviceable
      when he came, we had an infinity of maggots about algebra and logarithms
      to drive out of his head; but now he really is nearly as good an
      accountant as old Johns.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You would be sorry to part with him, and I cannot help hoping this may be
      made up.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t bring me any message! I&rsquo;ve said I&rsquo;ll listen to nothing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No; the poor boy&rsquo;s feelings are far too much wounded,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal.
      &lsquo;Whether rightly or wrongly, he fancies that his father and family have
      been slightingly spoken of, and he is exceedingly hurt.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;His father! I&rsquo;m sure I did not say a tenth part of what the fellow richly
      deserves. If the young gentleman is so touchy, he had better go back to
      Ireland again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing more favourable could Mr. Kendal obtain, though he thought Mr.
      Goldsmith uneasy, and perhaps impressed by the independence of his
      nephew&rsquo;s attitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an arduous office for a peace-maker, where neither party could
      comprehend the feelings of the other, but on his return he found that
      Ulick had stormed himself into comparative tranquillity, and was listening
      the better to the womankind, because they had paid due honour to the
      amiable ancestral Tigearnach and all his guttural posterity, whose savage
      exploits and bloody catastrophes acted as such a sedative, that by the
      time he had come down to Uncle Bryan of the Kaffir war, he actually owned
      that as to the mighty &lsquo;O,&rsquo; Mr. Goldsmith might have erred in sheer
      ignorance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;After all,&rsquo; said Albinia, &lsquo;U. O&rsquo;More is rather personal in writing to a
      creditor.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It might be worse,&rsquo; said Ulick, laughing, &lsquo;if my name was John. I. O&rsquo;More
      would be a dangerous confession. But I&rsquo;ll not be come round even by your
      fun, Mrs. Kendal, I&rsquo;ll not part with my father&rsquo;s name.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, that would be base,&rsquo; said Sophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who would wish to persuade you?&rsquo; added Albinia. &lsquo;I am sure you are right
      in refusing with your feelings; I only want you to forgive your uncle, and
      not to break with him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;d forgive him his ignorance, but my mother herself could not wish me to
      forgive what he said of my father.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And how if he thinks this explosion needs forgiveness?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He must do without it,&rsquo; said Ulick. &lsquo;No, I was cool, I assure you, cool
      and collected, but it was not fit for me to stand by and hear my father
      insulted.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia closed the difficult discussion by observing that it was time to
      dress, and Sophy followed her from the room burning with indignant
      sympathy. &lsquo;It would be meanly subservient to ask pardon for defending a
      father whom he thought maligned,&rsquo; said Albinia, and Sophy took exception
      at the word &lsquo;thought.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! of course <i>he</i> cannot be deceived!&rsquo; said Albinia&mdash;but no
      sooner were the words spoken than she was half-startled, half-charmed by
      finding they had evoked a glow of colour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How do you think it will end?&rsquo; asked Sophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can hardly fancy he will not be forgiven, and yet&mdash;it might be
      better.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I do think he would get on faster in India,&rsquo; said Sophy eagerly; &lsquo;he
      could do just as Gilbert might have done.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it possible for Albinia to have kept out of her eyes a significant
      glance, or to have disarmed her lips of a merry smile of amused
      encouragement! How she had looked she knew not, but the red deepened on
      Sophy&rsquo;s whole face, and after one inquiring gaze from the eyes they were
      cast down, and an ineffable brightness came over the expression, softening
      and embellishing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What have I done?&rsquo; thought Albinia. &lsquo;Never mind&mdash;it must have been
      all there, or it would not have been wakened so easily&mdash;if he goes
      they will have a scene first.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But when Mr. Kendal came back he only advised Ulick to go to his desk as
      usual the next day, as if nothing had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Ulick owned that, turn out as things might, he could not quit his work
      in the first ardour of his resentment, and with a great exertion of
      Christian forgiveness, he finally promised not to give notice of his
      retirement unless his uncle should repeat the offence. This time Albinia
      durst not look at Sophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rather according to his friend&rsquo;s hopes than his own, he was able to report
      at the close of the next day, that he had not &lsquo;had a word from his uncle,
      except a nod;&rsquo; and thus the days passed on, Andrew Goldsmith did not
      appear, and it became evident that he was to remain on sufferance as a
      clerk. Nor did Albinia and Sophy venture to renew the subject between
      themselves. At first there was consciousness in their silence; soon their
      minds were otherwise engrossed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Meadows was suddenly stricken with paralysis, and was thought to be
      dying. She recovered partial consciousness in the course of the next day,
      but was constantly moaning the name of her eldest and favourite
      granddaughter, and when telegraph and express train brought home the
      startled and trembling Lucy, she was led at once to the sick bed&mdash;where
      at her name there was the first gleam of anything like pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And where have you been, my dear, this long time?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been at&mdash;at Brighton, dear grandmamma,&rsquo; said Lucy, so much
      agitated as scarcely to be able to recall the name, or utter the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And&mdash;I say, my dear love,&rsquo; said Mrs. Meadows, earnestly and
      mysteriously, &lsquo;have you seen <i>him</i>?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Lucy turned scarlet with distress and confusion, but she was held
      fast, and grandmamma pursued, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure he has not his equal for
      handsomeness and stateliness, and there must have been a pair of you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear grandmamma, we must let Lucy go and take off her things; she shall
      come back presently, but she has had a long journey,&rsquo; interposed Albinia,
      seeing her ready to sink into the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mrs. Meadows had roused into eagerness, and would not let her go. &lsquo;I
      hope you danced with him, dear,&rsquo; she went on; &lsquo;and it&rsquo;s all nonsense about
      his being high and silent. Your papa is bent on it, and you&rsquo;ll live like a
      princess in India.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She takes you for your mother&mdash;she means papa, whispered Albinia,
      not without a secret flash at once of indignation at perceiving how his
      first love had been wasted, yet of exultation in finding that no one but
      herself had known how to love him; but poor Lucy, completely and
      helplessly overcome, could only exclaim in a faltering voice: &lsquo;Oh,
      grandmamma, don&rsquo;t&mdash;&rsquo; and Albinia was forced to disengage her, support
      her out of the room, and leaving her to her sister, hasten back to soothe
      the old lady, who had been terrified by her emotion. It had been a great
      mistake to bring her in abruptly, when tired with her journey, and not
      fully aware what awaited her. But there was at that time reason to think
      all would soon be over, and Albinia was startled and confused.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia had hitherto been the only efficient nurse of the family. Sophy&rsquo;s
      presence seemed to stir up instincts of the old wrangling habits, and the
      invalid was always fretful when left to her, so that to her own exceeding
      distress she was kept almost entirely out of the sick room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy, on the other hand, was extremely valuable there, her bright manner
      and unfailing chatter always amused if needful, and her light step and
      tender hand made her useful, and highly appreciated by the regular nurse.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first few days, they watched in awe for the last dread summons,
      but gradually it was impossible not to become in a manner habituated to
      the suspense, so that common things resumed their interest, and though
      Sophy was pained by the incongruity, it could not have been otherwise
      without the spirits and health giving way under the strain. Nothing could
      be more trying than to have the mind wrought up to hourly anticipation of
      the last parting, and then the delay, without the reaction of recovery,
      the spirit beyond all reach of intercourse, and the mortal frame
      languishing and drooping. Mr. Kendal had from the first contemplated the
      possibility of the long duration of such lingering, and did his utmost to
      promote such enlivenment and change for the attendants as was consistent
      with their care of the sufferer. They never dared to be all beyond call at
      once, since a very little agitation might easily suffice to bring on a
      fatal attack, and Albinia and Lucy were forced to share the hours of
      exercise and employment between them, and often Albinia could not leave
      the house and garden at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert was an excellent auxiliary, and would devote many an hour to the
      cheering of the poor shattered mind. His entrance seldom failed to break
      the thread of melancholy murmurs, and he had exactly the gentle, bright
      attentive manner best fitted to rouse and enliven. Nothing could be more
      irreproachable, than his conduct, and his consideration and gentleness so
      much endeared him, that he had never been so much at peace. All he dreaded
      was the leaving what was truly to him the sanctuary of home, he feared
      alike temptation and the effort of resistance and could not bear to go
      away when his grandmother was in so precarious a state, and he could so
      much lighten Mrs. Kendal&rsquo;s cares both by being with her, and by watching
      over Maurice. His parents were almost equally afraid of trusting him in
      the world; and the embodiment of the militia for the county offered a
      quasi profession, which would keep him at home and yet give him
      employment. He was very anxious to be allowed to apply for a commission,
      and pleaded so earnestly and humbly that it would be his best hope of
      avoiding his former errors, that Mr. Kendal yielded, though with doubt
      whether it would be well to confine him to so narrow a sphere. Meantime
      the corps was quartered at Bayford, and filled the streets with awkward
      louts in red jackets, who were inveterate in mistaking the right for the
      left, Gilbert had a certain shy pride in his soldiership, and Maurice
      stepped like a young Field Marshal when he saw his brother saluted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing had so much decided this step as the finding that young Dusautoy
      was to return to his college after Easter. He was at the Vicarage again,
      marking his haughty avoidance of the Kendal family, and to their great
      joy, Lucy did not appear distressed, she was completely absorbed in her
      grandmother, and shrank from all allusion to her lover. Had the small
      flutter of vanity been cured by a glimpse beyond her own corner of the
      world?
    </p>
    <p>
      But soon Albinia became sensible of an alteration in Gilbert. He had no
      sooner settled completely into his new employment, than a certain restless
      dissatisfaction seemed to have possessed him. He was fastidious at his
      meals, grumbled at his horse, scolded the groom, had fits of petulance
      towards his brother, and almost neglected Mrs. Meadows. No one could
      wonder at a youth growing weary of such attendance, but his tenderness and
      amiability had been his best points, and it was grievous to find them
      failing. Albinia would have charged the alteration on his brother
      officers, if they had not been a very steady and humdrum set, whose
      society Gilbert certainly did not prefer. She was more uneasy at finding
      that he sometimes saw Algernon Dusautoy, though for Lucy&rsquo;s sake, he always
      avoided bringing his name forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      A woman was ill in the bargeman&rsquo;s cottage by the towing-path, and Albinia
      had walked to see her. As she came down-stairs, she heard voices, and
      beheld Mr. Hope evidently on the same errand with herself, talking to
      Gilbert. She caught the words, ere she could safely descend the rickety
      staircase, Gilbert was saying,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! some happy pair from the High Street!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I beg your pardon,&rsquo; said Mr. Hope, &lsquo;I am so blind, I really took it for
      your sister, but our shopkeepers&rsquo; daughters do dress so!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia looking in the same direction, beheld in a walk that skirted the
      meadow towards the wood, two figures, of which only one was clearly
      visible, it was nearly a quarter of a mile off, but there was something
      about it that made her exclaim, &lsquo;Why, that&rsquo;s Mr. Cavendish Dusautoy! whom
      can he be walking with?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert started violently at hearing her behind him, and a word or two of
      greeting passed with Mr. Hope, then there was some spying at the pair, but
      they were getting further off, and disappeared in the wood, while Gilbert,
      screwing up his eyes, and stammering, declared he did not know; it might
      be, he did not think any one could be recognised at such a distance; and
      then saying that he had fallen in with Mr. Hope by chance, he hastened on.
      The curate made a brief visit, and walked home with her, examining her on
      her impression that the gentleman was young Dusautoy, and finally
      consulting her on the expediency of mentioning the suspicion to the vicar,
      in case he should be deluding some foolish tradesman&rsquo;s daughter. Albinia
      strongly advised his doing so; she had much faith in her own keen
      eyesight, and could not mistake the majestic mien of Algernon; she thought
      the vicar ought at once to be warned, but felt relieved that it was not
      her part to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was very glad when Mr. Hope took an opportunity of telling her that
      young Dusautoy was going to the Greenaways in a day or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to Gilbert, it was as if this departure had relieved him from an
      incubus; he was in better spirits from that moment, and returned to his
      habits of kindness to both grandmamma and Maurice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The manifold duties of head sick-nurse, governess, and housekeeper, were
      apt to clash, and valiant and unwearied as Albinia was, she was obliged
      perforce to leave the children more to others than she would have
      preferred. Little Albinia was all docility and sweetness, and already did
      such wonders with her ivory letters, that the exulting Sophy tried to
      abash Maurice by auguring that she would be the first to read; to which,
      undaunted, he replied, &lsquo;She&rsquo;ll never be a boy!&rsquo; Nevertheless Maurice was
      developing a species of conscience, rendering him trustworthy and obedient
      out of sight, better, in fact, alone with his own honour and his mother&rsquo;s
      commands, than with any authority that he could defy. He knew when his
      father meant to be obeyed, and Gilbert managed him easily; but he warred
      with Lucy, ruled Sophy, and had no chivalry for any one but little
      Albinia, nor obedience except for his mother, and was a terror to
      maid-servants and elder children. With much of promise, he was anything
      but an agreeable child, and whilst no one but herself ever punished,
      contradicted, or complained of him, Albinia had a task that would have
      made her very uneasy, had not her mind been too fresh and strong for
      over-sense of responsibility. Each immediate duty in its turn was
      sufficient for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maurice&rsquo;s shadow-like pursuit of Gilbert often took him off her hands. It
      might sometimes be troublesome to the elder brother, and now and then
      rewarded with a petulant rebuff, but Maurice was only the more
      pertinacious, and on the whole his allegiance was requited with ardent
      affection and unbounded indulgence. Nay, once when Maurice and his pony,
      one or both, were swept on by the whole hunt, and obliged to follow the
      hounds, Gilbert in his anxiety took leaps that he shuddered to remember,
      while the urchin sat the first gallantly, and though he fell into the next
      ditch, scrambled up on the instant, and was borne by his spirited pony
      over two more, amid universal applause. Mr. Nugent himself rode home with
      the brothers to tell the story; papa and mamma were too much elated at his
      prowess to scold.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eventful year 1854 had begun, and General Ferrars was summoned from
      Canada to a command in the East. On his arrival in England, he wrote to
      his brother and sister to meet him in London, and the aunts, delighted to
      gather their children once more round them, sent pressing invitations,
      only regretting that there was not room enough in the Family Office for
      the younger branches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ferrars&rsquo; first measure was to ride to Willow Lawn. Knocking at the
      door of his sister&rsquo;s morning-room, he found Maurice with a pouting lip,
      back rounded, and legs twisted, standing upon his elbows, which were
      planted upon the table on either side of a calico spelling-book. Mr.
      Kendal stood up straight before the fire, looking distressed and
      perplexed, and Albinia sat by, a little worn, a little irritable, and with
      the expression of a wilful victim.
    </p>
    <p>
      All greeted the new-comer warmly, and Maurice exclaimed, &lsquo;Mamma, I may
      have a holiday now!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not till you have learnt your spelling.&rsquo; There was some sharpness in the
      tone, and Maurice&rsquo;s shoulder-blades looked sulky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In consideration of his uncle,&rsquo; began Mr. Kendal, but she put her hand on
      the boy, saying, &lsquo;You know we agreed there were to be no holidays for a
      week, because we did not use the last properly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He moved off disconsolately, and his father said, &lsquo;I hope you are come to
      arrange the journey to London. Is Winifred coming with you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No; a hurry and confusion, and the good aunts would be too much for her,
      you will be the only one for inspection.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, take him with you, Maurice,&rsquo; said Albinia, &lsquo;he must see William.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You must be the exhibitor, then,&rsquo; her brother replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, Maurice, I know what you are come for, but you ought to know better
      than to persuade me, when you know there are six good reasons against my
      going.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know of one worth all the six.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal; &lsquo;I have been telling her that she is convincing me
      that I did wrong in allowing her to burthen herself with this charge.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s nothing to the purpose,&rsquo; said Albinia; &lsquo;having undertaken it, when
      you all saw the necessity, I cannot forsake it now&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If Mrs. Meadows were in the same condition as she was in two months ago,
      there might be a doubt,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal; but she is less dependent on
      your attention, and Lucy and Gilbert are most anxious to devote themselves
      to her in your absence.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know they all wish to be kind, but if anything went wrong, I should
      never forgive myself!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not if you went out for pleasure alone,&rsquo; said her brother; &lsquo;but
      relationship has demands.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course,&rsquo; she said, petulantly, &lsquo;if Edmund is resolved, I must go, but
      that does not convince me that it is right to leave everything to run riot
      here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kendal looked serious, and Mr. Ferrars feared that the winter cares
      had so far told on her temper, that perplexity made her wilful in
      self-sacrifice. There was a pause, but just as she began to perceive she
      had said something wrong, the lesser Maurice burst out in exultation,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There, it is not indestructible!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What mischief have you been about?&rsquo; The question was needless, for the
      table was strewn with snips of calico.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This nasty spelling-book! Lucy said it was called indestructible, because
      nobody could destroy it, but I&rsquo;ve taken my new knife to it. And see
      there!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And now can you make another?&rsquo; said his uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want <i>to</i>.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nor <i>one</i> either, sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal. &lsquo;What shall we have to tell
      Uncle William about you! I&rsquo;m afraid you are one of the chief causes of
      mamma not knowing how to go to London.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Maurice did not appear on the way to penitence, but his mother said,
      &lsquo;Bring me your knife.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He hung down his head, and obeyed without a word. She closed it, and laid
      it on the mantel-shelf, which served as a sort of pound for properties in
      sequestration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, then, go,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;you are too naughty for me to attend to you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But when will you, mamma?&rsquo; laying a hand on her dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Go away now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He slowly obeyed, and as the door shut, she said, &lsquo;There!&rsquo; in a tone as if
      her view was established.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You must send him to Fairmead,&rsquo; said the uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To &ldquo;terrify&rdquo; Winifred? No, no, I know better than that; Gilbert can look
      after him. I don&rsquo;t so much care about that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The admission was eagerly hailed, and objection after objection removed,
      and having recovered her good humour, she was candid, and owned how much
      she wished to go. &lsquo;I really want to make acquaintance with William. I&rsquo;ve
      never seen him since I came to my senses, and have only taken him on trust
      from you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish equally that he should see you,&rsquo; said her brother. &lsquo;It would be
      good for him, and I doubt whether he has any conception what you are
      like.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;d better stay at home, to leave you and Edmund to depict for his
      benefit a model impossible idol&mdash;the normal woman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Maurice looked at her, and shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No&mdash;it would be rather&mdash;it and its young one, eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Maurice took both her hands. &lsquo;I should not like to tell William what I
      shall believe if you do not come.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, what&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That Edmund is right, and you have been overtasked till you are careful
      and troubled about many things.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only too much bent on generous self-devotion,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal, eagerly;
      &lsquo;too unselfish to cast the balance of duties.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush, Edmund,&rsquo; said Albinia. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t deserve fine words. I honestly
      believe I want to do what is right, but I can&rsquo;t be sure what it is, and I
      have made quite fuss enough, so you two shall decide, and then I shall be
      made right anyway. Only do it from your consciences.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They looked at each other, taken aback by the sudden surrender. Mr.
      Ferrars waited, and her husband said, &lsquo;She ought to see her brother. She
      needs the change, and there is no sufficient cause to detain her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She must be content sometimes to trust,&rsquo; said Mr. Ferrars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aye, and all that will go wrong, when my back is turned.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let it,&rsquo; said her brother. &lsquo;The right which depends on a single human eye
      is not good for much. Let the weeds grow, or you can&rsquo;t pull them up.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let the mice play, that the cat may catch them,&rsquo; said Albinia, striving
      to hide her care. &lsquo;One good effect is, that Edmund has not begun to
      groan.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, in his anxiety that she should consent to enjoy herself, he had
      not had time to shrink from the introduction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside the door they found Maurice waiting, his spelling learnt from a
      fragment of the indestructible spelling-book, and the question followed,
      &lsquo;Now, mamma, you wont say I&rsquo;m too naughty for you to go to London and see
      Uncle William?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, my little boy, I mean to trust you, and tell Uncle William that my
      young soldier is learning the soldier&rsquo;s first duty&mdash;obedience.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And may I have my knife, mamma?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Papa had settled that question by himself taking it off the chimney-piece
      and restoring it. If mamma wished the penance to have been longer, she
      neither looked it nor said it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young people received the decision with acclamation, and the two elder
      ones vied with one another in attempts to set her mind at rest by
      undertaking everything, and promising for themselves and the children
      perfect regularity and harmony. Sophy, with a bluntness that King Lear
      would have highly disapproved, said, &lsquo;She was glad mamma was going, but
      she knew they should be all at sixes and sevens. She would do her best,
      and very bad it would be.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not if you don&rsquo;t make up your mind beforehand that it must be bad,&rsquo; said
      her uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy smiled, she was much less impervious to cheerful auguries, and spoke
      with gladness of the pleasure it would give her friend Genevieve to see
      Mrs. Kendal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ferrars had a short interview with Ulick, and was amused by observing
      that little Maurice had learnt as much Irish as Ulick had dropped. After
      the passing fever about his O had subsided, he was parting with some of
      his ultra-nationality. The whirr of his R&rsquo;s and his Irish idioms were far
      less perceptible, and though a word of attack on his country would put him
      on his mettle, and bring out the Kelt in full force, yet in his reasonable
      state, his good sense and love of order showed an evident development, and
      instead of contending that Galway was the most perfect county in the
      world, he only said it might yet be so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t he a noble fellow?&rsquo; cried Albinia, warmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said her brother; &lsquo;I doubt whether all the O&rsquo;Mores put together
      have ever made such a conquest as he has.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was fun to see how the aunts were dismayed to find one of the horde in
      full force here. I believe it was as a measure of precaution that they
      took Lucy away. I was very glad for Lucy to go, but hers was not exactly
      the danger.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ha!&rsquo; said Maurice; and Albinia blushed. Whereupon he said
      interrogatively, &lsquo;Hem?&rsquo; which made her laugh so consciously that he added,
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you go and be romantic about either of your young ladies, or there
      will be a general burning of fingers.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you knew all our secrets, Maurice, you would think me a model of
      prudence and forbearance.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ho!&rsquo; was his next interjection, &lsquo;so much the worse. For my own part, I
      don&rsquo;t expect prudence will come to you naturally till the little Awk has a
      lover.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Won&rsquo;t it come any other way?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, in <i>one</i> way,&rsquo; he said, gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And that way is not easily found by those who have neither humility nor
      patience,&rsquo; she said, sadly, &lsquo;who rush on their own will.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nay, Albinia, it is being sought, I do believe; and remember the lines&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Thine own mild energy bestow,
   And deepen while thou bidst it flow,
   More calm our stream of love.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      Forced to resign herself to her holiday, Albinia did so with a good grace,
      in imitation of her brother, who assured her that he had brought a bottle
      of Lethe, and had therein drowned wife, children, and parish. Mr. Kendal&rsquo;s
      spirits, as usual, rose higher every mile from Bayford, and they were a
      very lively party when they arrived in Mayfair.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good aunts were delighted to have round them all those whom they
      called their children; all except Fred, whom the new arrangements had sent
      to rejoin his regiment in Ireland.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sinewy, spare, and wiry, with keen gray eyes under straight brows, narrow
      temples, a sunburnt face, and alert, upright bearing and quick step,
      William Ferrars was every inch a soldier; but nothing so much struck Mr.
      and Mrs. Kendal as the likeness to their little Maurice, though it
      consisted more in air and gesture than in feature. His speech was brief
      and to the point, softened into delicately-polished courtesy towards
      womankind, in the condescension of strength to weakness&mdash;the quality
      he evidently thought their chief characteristic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia was amused as she watched him with grown-up eyes, and compared
      present with past impressions. She could now imagine that she had been an
      inconvenient charge to a young soldier brother, and that he had been glad
      to make her over to the aunts, only petting and indulging her as a child;
      looking down on her fancies, and smiling at her sauciness when she was an
      enthusiastic maiden&mdash;treatment which she had so much resented, that
      she had direfully offended Maurice by pronouncing William a mere martinet,
      when she was hurt at his neither reading the Curse of Kehama, nor entering
      into her plans for Fairmead school.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having herself become a worker, she could better appreciate a man who had
      seen and acted instead of reading, recollected herself as an emanation of
      conceit, and felt shy and anxious, even more for her husband than for
      herself. How would the scholar and the soldier fare together? and could
      she and Maurice keep them from wearying of each other? She had little
      trust in her own fascinations, though she saw the General&rsquo;s eye
      approvingly fixed on her, and believing herself to be a more pleasing
      object in her womanly bloom than in her unformed girlhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How does the Montreal affair go on?&rsquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What affair?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fred and Miss Kinnaird.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am sorry to say he has not put it out of his head.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Surely she is a very nice person.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pshaw! He has no right to think of a wife these dozen years.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not even think? When he is not to have one at any rate till he is a field
      officer!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And he is a fool to have one then. A mere encumbrance to himself and the
      entire corps.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I know,&rsquo; said Albinia, &lsquo;she always gets the best cabin.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And that is no place for her! No man, as I have told Fred over and over
      again, ought to drag a woman into hardships for which she is not fitted,
      and where she interferes with his effectiveness and the comfort of every
      one else.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The identical lecture of twelve years since, when he had feared Albinia&rsquo;s
      becoming this inconvenient appendage! If he had repeated it on all like
      occasions, she did not wonder that it had wearied his aide-de-camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;the backwoods may have fitted Miss Emily for the
      life; and I can&rsquo;t but be glad of Fred&rsquo;s having been steady to anything.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Considering this speech like the Kehama days, the General went on to
      dilate on the damage that marriage was to the &lsquo;service,&rsquo; removing the best
      officers, first from the mess, and then from the army.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a pity William was born too late to be a Knight of St. John!&rsquo; said
      Albinia.
    </p>
    <p>
      All laughed, but she doubted whether he were pleased, for he addressed
      himself to one of the aunts, while Maurice spoke to her in an under tone&mdash;&lsquo;I
      believe he is quite right. Homes are better for the individual man, but
      not for the service. How remarkably the analogy holds with this other
      service!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You mean what St. Paul says of the married and unmarried?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I always think he and his sayings are the most living lessons I know on
      the requirements of the other army.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia mused on the insensible change in Maurice. He had not embraced his
      profession entirely by choice. It had always been understood that one of
      the younger branches must take the family living; and as Fred had spurned
      study, he had been bred up to consider it as his fate, and if he had ever
      had other wishes, he had entirely accepted his destiny, and sincerely
      turned to his vocation. The knowledge that he must be a clergyman had
      ruled him and formed him from his youth, and acting through him on his
      sister, had rendered her more than the accomplished, prosperous young lady
      her aunts meant to have made her. Yet, even up to a year or two after his
      Ordination, there had been a sense of sacrifice; he loved sporting, and
      even balls, and it had been an effort to renounce them. He had avoided
      coming to London because his keen enjoyment of society tended to make him
      discontented with his narrow sphere; she had even known him to hesitate to
      ride with the staff at a review, lest he should make himself liable to
      repinings. And now how entirely had all this passed away, not merely by
      outgrowing the enterprising temper and boyish habits, nor by contentment
      in a happy home, but by the sufficiency and rest of his service, the
      engrossment in the charge from his great Captain. Without being himself
      aware of it, he had ceased to distrust a holiday, because it was no longer
      a temptation; and his animation and mirth were the more free, because
      self-regulation was so thoroughly established, that restraint was no
      longer felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Annesley was talking of the little Kendals, who she had ruled should
      be at Fairmead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Maurice, &lsquo;Albinia thought her son too mighty for Winifred. Our
      laudable efforts at cousinly friendship usually produce war-whoops that
      bring the two mammas each to snatch her own offspring from the fray, with
      a scolding for the sake of appearances though believing the other the only
      guilty party.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, Maurice,&rsquo; cried Albinia, &lsquo;you confess how fond Mary is of setting
      people to rights.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well&mdash;when Maurice bullies Alby.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aye, you talk of the mammas, and you only want to make out poor Maurice
      the aggressor.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never mind, they will work in better than if they were fabulous children.
      Ah, you are going to contend that yours is a fabulous child. Take care I
      don&rsquo;t come on you with the indestructible&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take care I don&rsquo;t come on you with Mary&rsquo;s lessons to Colonel Bury on the
      game-law.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Does it not do one good to see those two quarrelling just like old
      times?&rsquo; exclaimed one aunt to the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And William looking on as contemptuous as ever?&rsquo; said Albinia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not at all. I rejoice to have this week with you. I should like to see
      your boy. Maurice says he is a thorough young soldier.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kendal looked pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man of study had a penchant for the man of action, and the
      brothers-in-law were drawing together. Mars, the great geographical
      master, was but opening his gloomy school on the Turkish soil, and the
      world was discovering its ignorance beyond the Pinnock&rsquo;s Catechisms of its
      youth. Maurice treated Mr. Kendal as a dictionary, and his stores of
      Byzantine, Othman, and Austrian lore, chimed in with the perceptions of
      the General, who, going by military maps, described plans of operations
      which Mr. Kendal could hardly believe he had not found in history, while
      he could as little credit that Mr. Kendal had neither studied tactics, nor
      seen the spots of which he could tell such serviceable minutiae.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had their heads together over the map the whole evening, and the next
      morning, when the General began to ask questions about Turkish, his sister
      was proud to hear her husband answering with the directness and precision
      dear to a military man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s an uncommonly learned man, Albinia&rsquo;s husband,&rsquo; began the General,
      as soon as he had started with his brother on a round of errands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never met a man of more profound and universal knowledge.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t see that he is so grave and unlike other people. Fred reported
      that he was silence itself, and she might as well have married Hamlet&rsquo;s
      ghost.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fred saw him at a party,&rsquo; said Maurice; then remembering that this might
      not be explanatory, he added, &lsquo;He shines most when at ease, and every year
      since his marriage has improved and enlivened him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am satisfied. I hardly knew how to judge, though I did not think myself
      called upon to remonstrate against the marriage, as the aunts wished. I
      knew I might depend on you, and I thought it high time that she should be
      settled.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have been constantly admiring her discernment, for I own that at first
      his reserve stood very much in my way, but since she has raised his
      spirits, and taught him to exert himself, he has been a most valuable
      brother to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you think her happy? I was surprised to see her such a fine-looking
      woman; my aunts had croaked so much about his children and his mother,
      that I thought she would be worn to a shadow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very happy. She has casual troubles, and a great deal of work, but that
      is what she is made for.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How does she get on with his children?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hearty love for them has carried her through the first difficulties,
      which appalled me, for they had been greatly mismanaged. I am afraid that
      she has not been able to undo some of the past evil; and with all her good
      intentions, I am sometimes afraid whether she is old enough to deal with
      grown-up young people.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t mean that Kendal&rsquo;s children are grown up? I should think him
      younger than I am.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is so, but civil servants marry early, and not always wisely; and the
      son is about twenty. Poor Albinia dotes on him, and has done more for him
      than ever his father did; but the lad is weak and tender every way, with
      no stamina, moral or physical, and with just enough property to do him
      harm. He has been at Oxford and has failed, and now he is in the militia,
      but what can be expected of a boy in a country town, with nothing to do? I
      did not like his looks last week, and I don&rsquo;t think his being there,
      always idle, is good for that little manly scamp of Albinia&rsquo;s own.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t they put him into the service?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is too old.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not too old for the cavalry!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He can ride, certainly, and is a tall, good-looking fellow; but I should
      not have thought him the stuff to make a dragoon. He has always been
      puling and delicate, unfit for school, wanting force.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wanting discipline,&rsquo; said the General. &lsquo;I have seen a year in a good
      regiment make an excellent officer of that very stamp of youngster, just
      wanting a mould to give him substance.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The regiment should be a very good one,&rsquo; said Mr. Ferrars; &lsquo;he would be
      only too easily drawn in by the bad style of subaltern.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Put him into the 25th Lancers,&rsquo; said the General, &lsquo;and set Fred to look
      after him. Rattlepate as he is, he can take excellent care of a lad to
      whom he takes a fancy, and if Albinia asked him, he would do it with all
      his heart.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish you would propose it, though I am afraid his father will never
      consent. I would do a great deal to get him away before he has led little
      Maurice into harm.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This consideration moved the Rector of Fairmead himself to broach the
      subject, but neither Mr. Kendal nor Albinia could think of venturing their
      fragile son in the army, though assured that there was little chance that
      the 25th Lancers would be summoned to the east, and they would only hold
      out hopes of little Maurice by and by.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia&rsquo;s martial ardour was revived as she listened with greater grasp of
      comprehension to subjects familiar in her girlhood. She again met old
      friends of her father, the lingering glories of the Peninsula and
      Waterloo, who liked her for her own sake as well as for her father&rsquo;s,
      while Maurice looked on, amused by her husband&rsquo;s silent pride in her, and
      her hourly progress in the regard of the General, who began to talk of
      making a long visit to Fairmead, after what he expected would be a slight
      demonstration on the Danube. He even began to regret the briefness of the
      time that he could spend in their society.
    </p>
    <p>
      Much was crowded into that week, but Albinia contrived to find an hour for
      a call on her little French friend, to whom she had already forwarded the
      parcels she had brought from home&mdash;a great barm-brack from Biddy, and
      a store of delicate convent confections from Hadminster.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was set down at a sober old house in the lawyers&rsquo; quarter of the
      world, and conducted to a pretty, though rather littered drawing-room,
      where she found a delicate-looking young mamma, and various small
      children.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m so glad,&rsquo; said little Mrs. Rainsforth, &lsquo;that you have been able to
      come; it will be such a pleasure to dear Miss Durant; and while one of the
      children was sent to summon the governess, the lady continued, nervously
      but warmly, &lsquo;I hope you will think Miss Durant looking well; I am afraid
      she shuts herself up too much. I&rsquo;m sure she is the greatest comfort, the
      greatest blessing to us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia&rsquo;s reply was prevented by a rush of children, followed by the dear
      little trim, slight figure. There was no fear that Genevieve did not look
      well or happy. Her olive complexion was healthy; her dark eyes lustrous
      with gladness; her smile frank and unquelled; her movements full of
      elastic life.
    </p>
    <p>
      She led the way to the back parlour, dingy by nature, but bearing living
      evidence to the charm which she infused into any room. Scratched table,
      desks, copybooks, and worn grammars, had more the air of a comfortable
      occupation than of the shabby haunt of irksome taskwork. There were
      flowers in the window, and the children&rsquo;s treasures were arranged with
      taste. Genevieve loved her school-room, and showed off its little
      advantages with pretty exultation. If Mrs. Kendal could only see how well
      it looked with the curtains down, after tea!
    </p>
    <p>
      And then came the long, long talk over home affairs, and the history of
      half the population of Bayford, Genevieve making inquiries, and drinking
      in the answers as if she could not make enough of her enjoyment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not till all the rest had been discussed, did she say, with dropped
      eyelids, and a little blush, &lsquo;Is Mr. Gilbert Kendal quite strong?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you, he has been much better this winter, and so useful and kind in
      nursing grandmamma!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, he was always kind.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He was going to beg me to remember him to you, but he broke off, and said
      you would not care.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I care for all goodness towards me,&rsquo; answered Genevieve, lifting her eyes
      with a flash of inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am afraid he is as bad as ever, poor fellow,&rsquo; said Albinia, with a
      little smile and sigh; &lsquo;but he has behaved very well. I must tell you that
      you were in the same train with him on his journey from Oxford, and he was
      ashamed to meet your eye.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, I remember well. I thought I saw him. I was bringing George and Fanny
      from a visit to their aunts, and I was sure it must be Mr. Gilbert.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As prudent as ever, Genevieve.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It would not have been right,&rsquo; she said, blushing; &lsquo;but it was such a
      treat to see a Bayford face, that I had nearly sprung out of the
      waiting-room to speak to him at the first impulse.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My poor little exile!&rsquo; said Albinia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, that is not my name. Call me my aunt&rsquo;s bread-winner. That&rsquo;s my pride!
      I mean my cause of thankfulness. I could not have earned half so much at
      home.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope indeed you have a home here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That I have,&rsquo; she fervently answered. &lsquo;Oh, without being a homeless
      orphan, one does not learn what kind hearts there are. Mr. and Mrs.
      Rainsforth seemed only to fear that they should not be good enough to me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you mean that you found it a little oppressive?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fi donc, Madame! Yet I must own that with her timid uneasy way, and his
      so perfect courtesy, they did alarm me a little at first. I pitied them,
      for I saw them so resolved not to let me feel myself de trop, that I knew
      I was in their way.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did not that vex you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, I suppose they set their inconvenience against the needs of their
      children, and my concern was to do my duty, and be as little troublesome
      as possible. They pressed me to spend my evenings with them, but I thought
      that would be too hard on them, so I told them I preferred the last hours
      alone, and I do not come in unless there are others to prevent their being
      tete-a-tete.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very wise. And do you not find it lonely?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is my time for reading&mdash;my time for letters&mdash;my time for
      being at home!&rsquo; cried Genevieve. &lsquo;Now however that I hope I am no longer a
      weight on them, Mrs. Rainsforth will sometimes ask me to come and sing to
      him, or read aloud, when he comes home so tired that he cannot speak, and
      her voice is weak. Alas! they are both so fragile, so delicate.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her soul was evidently with them and with her charges, of whom there was
      so much to say, that the carriage came all too soon to hurry Albinia away
      from the sight of that buoyant sweetness and capacity of happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was rather startled by Miss Ferrars saying, &lsquo;By-the-by, Albinia, how
      was it that you never told us of the development of the Infant prodigy?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean, Aunt Gertrude.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember that boy, that Mrs. Dusautoy Cavendish&rsquo;s son, whom
      that poor little companion of hers used to call l&rsquo;Enfant prodigue. I did
      not know he was a neighbour of yours, as I find from Lucy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What did Lucy tell you about him? She did not meet him!&rsquo; cried Albinia,
      endeavouring not to betray her alarm. &lsquo;I mean, did she meet him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed,&rsquo; said Miss Ferrars, &lsquo;you should have warned us if you had any
      objection, my dear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, but what did happen?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, nothing alarming, I assure you. They met at a ball at Brighton; Lucy
      introduced him, and said he was your vicar&rsquo;s nephew; they danced together.
      I think only once.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish you had mentioned it. When did it happen?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can hardly tell. I think she had been about a fortnight with us, but
      she seemed so indifferent that I should never have thought it worth
      mentioning. I remember my sister thought of asking him to a little evening
      party of ours, and Lucy dissuading her. Now, really, Albinia, don&rsquo;t look
      as if we had been betraying our trust. You never gave us any reason to
      think&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no. I beg your pardon, dear aunt. I hope there&rsquo;s no harm done. If I
      could have thought of his turning up, I would&mdash;But I hope it is all
      right.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Such good accounts came from both homes, and the General was so unwilling
      to part with his brother and sister, that he persuaded them to accompany
      him to Southampton for embarkation. They all felt that these last days,
      precious now, might be doubly precious by-and-by, and alone with them and
      free from the kindly scrutiny of the good aunts, William expanded and
      evinced more warm fraternal feeling than he had ever manifested. He
      surprised his sister by thanking her warmly for having come to meet him.
      &lsquo;I am glad to have been with you, Albinia; I am glad to have seen your
      husband. I have told Maurice that I am heartily rejoiced to see you in
      such excellent hands.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You must come and see the children, and know him better.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope so, when this affair is over, and I expect it will be soon
      settled. Anyway, I am glad we have been together. If we meet again, we
      will try to see more of one another.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He had said much more to his brother, expressing regret that he had been
      so much separated from his sister. Thorough soldier as he was, and ardent
      for active service, the sight of her and her husband had renewed gentler
      thoughts, and he was so far growing old that the idea of home and rest
      came invitingly before him. He was softened at the parting, and when he
      wrung their hands for the last time on the deck of the steamer, they were
      glad that his last words were, &lsquo;God bless you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There had been some uncertainty as to the time of his sailing, and
      Fairmead and Bayford had been told that unless their travellers arrived by
      the last reasonable train on Friday, they were not to be expected till the
      same time on Saturday, Maurice having concocted a scheme for crossing by
      several junction lines, so as to save waiting; but they had not reckoned
      on the discourtesies of two rival companies whose lines met at the same
      station, and the southern train was only in time to hear the parting snort
      of the engine that it professed to catch.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Ferrars&rsquo; nature, above all when sore with farewells, was not made to
      submit to having time wasted by treacherous trains on a cold wintry day,
      and at a small new station, with an apology for a waiting-room, no
      bookstall, and nothing to eat but greasy gingerbread and hard apples.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maurice relieved his feelings by heartily rowing all the officials, but he
      could obtain no redress, as he knew full well the whole time, nor would
      any train pick them up for full three hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      So indignant was he, that amusement rendered Albinia patient, especially
      when he took to striding up and down the platform, devising cases in which
      the delay might be actionable, and vituperating the placability of Mr.
      Kendal, who having wrapt up his wife in plaids and seated her on the top
      of the luggage, had set his back to the wall, and was lost to the present
      world in a book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never mind, Maurice,&rsquo; said Albinia; &lsquo;in any other circumstances we should
      think three hours of each other a great boon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If anything could be an aggravation, it would be to see Albinia
      philosophical.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You make me so on the principle of the Helots and Spartans.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was possible to get to Hadminster by half-past seven, and on to Bayford
      by nine o&rsquo;clock, but Fairmead lay further from the line, and the next
      train did not stop at the nearest station, so Maurice agreed to sleep at
      Bayford that night; and this settled, set out with his sister to explore
      the neighbourhood for eatables and church architecture. They made an
      ineffectual attempt to rouse Mr. Kendal to go with them, but he was far
      too deep in his book, and only muttered something about looking after the
      luggage. They found a stale loaf of bread, and a hideous church, but it
      was a merry walk, and brought them back in their liveliest mood, which
      lasted even to pronouncing it &lsquo;great fun&rsquo; that the Hadminster flies were
      all at a ball, and that the omnibus must convey them home by the full
      moonlight.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Slowly the omnibus rumbled over the wooden bridge, and then with a sudden
      impulse it thundered up to the front door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia jumped out, and caught Sophy in her arms, exclaiming, &lsquo;And how are
      you all, my dear?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We had quite given you up,&rsquo; Gilbert was saying. &lsquo;The fire is in the
      library,&rsquo; he added, as Mr. Kendal was opening the drawing-room door, and
      closing it in haste at the sight of a pale, uninviting patch of moonlight,
      and the rush of a blast of cold wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And how is grandmamma? and the children? My Sophy, you don&rsquo;t look well,
      and where&rsquo;s Lucy?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Ere she could receive an answer, down jumped, two steps at a time, a
      half-dressed figure, all white stout legs and arms which were speedily
      hugging mamma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s my man!&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal, &lsquo;a good boy, I know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No!&rsquo; cried the bold voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No?&rsquo; (incredulously) what have you been doing?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I broke the conservatory with the marble dog, and&mdash;&rsquo; he looked at
      Gilbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s my brave boy,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal, who had suffered so much from his
      elder son&rsquo;s equivocation as to be ready to overlook anything for the sake
      of truth. &lsquo;Here, Uncle Maurice, shake hands with your godson, who always
      tells truth.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The urchin folded his arms on his bosom, and looked like a young
      Bonaparte.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s your hand? said his uncle. &lsquo;Wont you give it to me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He will be wiser to-morrow, if you are so good as to try him again,&rsquo; said
      Albinia, who knew nothing did him more harm than creating a commotion by
      his caprices; &lsquo;he is up too late, and fractious with sleepiness. Go to bed
      now, my dear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall not be wiser to-morrow,&rsquo; quoth the child, marching out of the
      room in defiance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Monkey! what&rsquo;s the matter now?&rsquo; exclaimed Albinia; &lsquo;I suppose you have
      all been spoiling him. But what&rsquo;s become of Lucy?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gilbert said she was at the Dusautoys,&rsquo; replied Sophy; &lsquo;but if you would
      but come to grandmamma! She found out that you were expected, and she is
      in such a state that we have not known what to do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll come, only, Sophy dear, please order tea and something to eat. Your
      uncle looks ravenous.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She broke off, as there advanced into the room a being like Lucy, but
      covered with streams and spatters of flowing sable tears, like a heraldic
      decoration, over face, neck, and dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      All unconscious, she came with outstretched hands and words of welcome,
      but an astonished cry of &lsquo;Lucy!&rsquo; met her, and casting her eyes on her
      dress, she screamed, &lsquo;Oh goodness! it&rsquo;s ink!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where can you have been? what have you been doing?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&mdash;don&rsquo;t know&mdash;Oh! it was the great inkstand, and not the scent&mdash;Oh!
      it is all over me! It&rsquo;s in my hair!&rsquo; shuddering. &lsquo;Oh, dear! oh dear! I
      shall never get it out!&rsquo; and off she rushed, followed by Gilbert, and was
      soon heard calling the maids to bring hot water to her room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is all this?&rsquo; asked Mr. Kendal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do not know,&rsquo; mournfully answered Sophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia left the library, and taking a candle, went into the empty
      drawing-room. The moonlight shone white upon the table, and showed the
      large cut-glass ink-bottle in a pool of its own contents; and the
      sofa-cover had black spots and stains as if it had partaken of the
      libation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy saw, and stood like a statue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You know nothing, I am sure,&rsquo; said Albinia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing!&rsquo; repeated Sophy, with a blank look of wretchedness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you please, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said the nurse at the door, &lsquo;could you be kind
      enough to come to Mrs. Meadows, she will be quieter when she has seen
      you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sophy dear, we must leave it now,&rsquo; said Albinia. &lsquo;You must see to their
      tea, they have had nothing since breakfast.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She hastened to the sick room, where she found Mrs. Meadows in a painful
      state of agitation and excitement. The nurse said that until this evening,
      she had been as usual, but finding that Mrs. Kendal was expected, she had
      been very restless; Miss Kendal was out, and neither Miss Sophy nor Mr.
      Gilbert could soothe her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She eagerly grasped the hand of Albinia who bent down to kiss her, and
      asked how she had been.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! my dear, very unwell, very. They should not leave me to myself so
      long, my dear. I thought you would never come back,&rsquo; and she began to cry,
      and say, &lsquo;no one cared for an old woman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia assured her that she was not going away, and restrained her own
      eager and bewildered feelings to tranquillize her, by prosing on in the
      lengthy manner which always soothed the poor old lady. It was a great
      penance, in her anxiety to investigate the mysteries that seemed to swarm
      in the house, but at last she was able to leave the bedside, though not
      till she had been twice summoned to tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy, lividly pale, was presiding with trembling hands; Gilbert, flushed
      and nervous, waiting on every one, and trying to be lively and at ease,
      but secret distress was equally traceable in each.
    </p>
    <p>
      She durst only ask after the children, and heard that her little namesake
      had been as usual as good and sweet as child could be. And Maurice?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s a famous fellow, went on capitally,&rsquo; said Gilbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, till yesterday,&rsquo; hoarsely gasped Sophy, sincerity wrenching out the
      protest by force.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, what has he been doing to the conservatory?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He let the little marble dog down from the morning-room window with my
      netting silk; it fell, and made a great hole,&rsquo; said Sophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What, as a form of dawdling at his lessons?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, but he has not been at all tiresome about them except to-day and
      yesterday.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And he has told the exact truth,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal, &lsquo;his gallant
      confession has earned the little cannon I promised him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I believe,&rsquo; said Albinia, &lsquo;that it would be greater merit in Maurice to
      learn forbearance than to speak truth and be praised for it. I have never
      seen his truth really tried.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I value truth above all other qualities,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So do I,&rsquo; said Albinia, &lsquo;and it is my greatest joy in that little fellow;
      but some time or other it must cost him something, or it will not be
      tested.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kendal did not like this, and repeated that he must have his cannon.
      Albinia fancied that she heard something like a groan from Gilbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they broke up for the night, she threw her arm round Sophy as they
      went upstairs, saying, &lsquo;My poor dear, you look half dead. Have things been
      going very wrong?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only these two days,&rsquo; said Sophy, &lsquo;and I don&rsquo;t know that they have
      either. I am glad you are come!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What kind of things?&rsquo; said Albinia, following her into her room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t ask,&rsquo; at first began Sophy, but then, frowning as if she could
      hardly speak, she added, &lsquo;I mean, I don&rsquo;t know whether it is my own horrid
      way, or that there is really an atmosphere of something I don&rsquo;t make out.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t you tell me Lucy was at the Vicarage?&rsquo; said Albinia, suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gilbert said yes, when I asked if she could be with the Dusautoys,&rsquo; said
      Sophy, &lsquo;when grandmamma wanted her and she did not come. Mamma, please
      don&rsquo;t think of what I said, for very likely it is only that I am cross,
      because of being left alone with grandmamma so long this evening, and then
      Maurice being slow at his lessons.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are not cross, Sophy; you are worn out, and perplexed, and unhappy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! not now you are come home,&rsquo; and Sophy laid her head on her shoulder
      and cried with relief and exhaustion. Albinia caressed her, saying,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My trust, my mainstay, my poor Sophy! There, go to bed and sleep, and
      don&rsquo;t think of it now. Only first tell me one thing, is that Algernon at
      home?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No!&rsquo; said Sophy, vehemently, &lsquo;certainly not!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia breathed more freely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Everybody,&rsquo; said Sophy, collecting herself, &lsquo;has gone on well, Gilbert
      and Lucy have been as kind as could be, and Maurice very good, but
      yesterday morning he went on in his foolish way at lessons, and Gilbert
      took him out riding before he had finished them. They came in very late,
      and I think Maurice must have been overtired, for he was so idle this
      morning, that I threatened to tell, and put him in mind of the cannon papa
      promised him; but somehow I must have managed badly for he only grew more
      defiant, and ended by letting the marble dog out of window, so that it
      went through the roof of the conservatory.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, of course it was your fault, or the marble dog&rsquo;s,&rsquo; said Albinia,
      smiling, and stroking her fondly. &lsquo;Ah! we ought to have come home at the
      fixed time, and not left you to their mercy; but one could not hurry away
      from William, when he was so much more sorry to leave us than we ever
      expected.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! mamma, don&rsquo;t talk so! We were so glad. If only we could help being
      such a nuisance!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia contrived to laugh, and withdrew, intending to make a visit of
      inquiry to Lucy, but she could not refuse herself the refreshment of a
      kiss to the little darling who could have no guile to hide, no wrong to
      confess. She had never so much realized the value of the certainty of
      innocence as when she hung over the crib, and thought that when those dark
      fringed lids were lifted, the eyes would flash with delight at meeting
      her, without one drawback.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly a loud roar burst from the little room next to Gilbert&rsquo;s, in
      which Maurice had lately been installed. She hurried swiftly in that
      direction, but a passage and some steps lay between, and Gilbert had been
      beforehand with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She heard the words, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t care! I don&rsquo;t care if it is manly! I will
      tell; I can&rsquo;t bear this!&rsquo; then as his brother seemed to be hushing him, he
      burst out again, &lsquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have minded if papa wouldn&rsquo;t give me the
      cannon, but he will, and that&rsquo;s as bad as telling a lie!&rsquo; I can&rsquo;t sleep if
      you wont let me off my promise!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Trembling from head to foot, her voice low and quivering with
      concentrated, incredulous wrath, Albinia advanced. &lsquo;Are you teaching my
      child falsehood?&rsquo; she said; and Gilbert felt as if her look were worse to
      him than a thousand deaths.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O mamma! mamma! Gilbert! let me tell her,&rsquo; cried the child; and Albinia,
      throwing herself on her knees, clasped him in her arms, as though
      snatching him from the demon of deceit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tell all, Maurice,&rsquo; said Gilbert, folding his arms; &lsquo;it is to your
      credit, if you would believe so. I shall be glad to have this misery ended
      any way! It was all for the sake of others.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mamma,&rsquo; Maurice said, in the midst of these mutterings of his unhappy
      brother, &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t have the cannon without papa knowing it all. I couldn&rsquo;t
      shake hands with Uncle Maurice for telling the truth, for I had not told
      it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what is it, my boy?&rsquo; tell me now, no one can hinder you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I scratched and fought him&mdash;Mr. Cavendish Dusautoy&mdash;I kicked
      down the decanter of wine. They told me it was manly not to tell, and I
      promised.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He was crying with the exceeding pain and distress of a child whose tears
      were rare, and Albinia rocked him in her arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert cautiously shut the door, and said sadly, &lsquo;Maurice behaved nobly,
      if he would only believe so. You would be proud of your son if you had
      seen him. They wanted to make him drink wine, and he was fighting them
      off.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And where were you, Gilbert, you to whom I trusted him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I could not help it,&rsquo; said Gilbert; then as her lip curled with contempt,
      and her eye spoke disappointment, he cast himself on the ground,
      exclaiming, &lsquo;Oh, if you knew how I have been mixed up with others, and
      what I have gone through, you would pity me. Oh, Maurice, don&rsquo;t cry, when
      I would give worlds to be like you. Why do you let him cry? why don&rsquo;t you
      tell him what a brave noble boy he is?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to think or believe,&rsquo; said Albinia, coldly, but
      returning vehemently to her child, she continued, &lsquo;Maurice, my dear, no
      one is angry with you! You, at least, I can depend on. Tell me where you
      have been, and what they have been doing to you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Even with Gilbert&rsquo;s explanations, she could hardly understand Maurice&rsquo;s
      narrative, but she gathered that on Thursday, the brothers had ridden out,
      and were about to turn homewards, when Archie Tritton, of whom to her
      vexation Maurice spoke familiarly, had told Gilbert that a friend was
      waiting for him at the inn connected with the training stables, three
      miles farther on. Gilbert had demurred, but was told the matter would
      brook no delay, and yielded on being pressed. He tried to suppress the
      friend&rsquo;s name, but Maurice had called him Mr. Cavendish Dusautoy.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Gilbert was engaged with him, Tritton had introduced Maurice to the
      horses and stable boys, whose trade had inspired him with such emulation,
      that he broke off in the midst of his confession to ask whether he could
      be a jockey and also a gentleman. All this had detained them till so late,
      that they had been drawn into staying to dinner. Maurice had gone on very
      happily, secure that he was right in Gilbert&rsquo;s hands, and only laying up a
      few curious words for explanation; but when he was asked to drink wine, he
      stoutly answered that mamma did not allow it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Idle mischief prompted Dusautoy and Tritton to set themselves to overpower
      his resistance. Gilbert&rsquo;s feeble remonstrances were treated as a jest, and
      Algernon, who could brook no opposition, swore that he would conquer the
      little prig. Maurice found himself pinioned by strong arms, but determined
      and spirited, he made a vigorous struggle, and so judiciously aimed a
      furious kick, that Mr. Cavendish Dusautoy staggered back, stumbling
      against the table, and causing a general overthrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The victory was with Maurice, but warned as he had often been against
      using his natural weapons, he thought himself guilty of a great crime. The
      others, including, alas! Gilbert, strove to persuade him it was a joke,
      and, above all, to bind him to silence, for Tritton and Dusautoy would
      never have ventured so far, could they have imagined the possibility of
      such terms as those on which he lived with his parents. They attacked the
      poor child on the score of his manly aspirations, telling him it was
      babyish to tell mamma and sisters everything, a practice fit for girls,
      not for boys or men. These assurances extracted a pledge of secrecy, which
      was kept as long as his mother was absent, and only rendered him reckless
      by the sense that he had forfeited the prize of good conduct; but the
      sight of her renewed the instinct of confidence, and his father&rsquo;s reliance
      on his truth so acted on his sense of honour, that he could not hold his
      peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;May I tell papa? and will he let me have the cannon?&rsquo; he finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You shall certainly tell him, my dear, dear little boy, and we will see
      what he says about the cannon,&rsquo; she said, fervently kissing him. &lsquo;It will
      be some comfort for him to hear how you have behaved, my precious little
      man. I thank God with all my heart that He has saved you from putting
      anything before truth. I little thought I was leaving you to a tempter!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The child did not fully understand her. His was a very simple nature, and
      he was tired out by conflicting emotions. His breast was relieved, and his
      mother caressed him; he cared for nothing more, and drawing her hand so as
      to rest his cheek on it, he looked up in her face with soft weary
      happiness in his eyes, then let the lids sink over them, and fell
      peacefully asleep, while the others talked on. &lsquo;At least you will do me
      the poor justice of believing it was not willingly,&rsquo; said Gilbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish you would not talk to me,&rsquo; she answered, averting her face and
      speaking low as if to cut the heart; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want to reproach you, and I
      can&rsquo;t speak to you properly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you would only hear me, my only friend and helper! But it was all that
      was wanting! I have forfeited even your toleration! I wonder why I was
      born!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He was taking up his light to depart, but Albinia&rsquo;s fear of her own temper
      made her suspect that she had spoken vindictively, and she said, &lsquo;What can
      I do, Gilbert? Here is this poor child, whom I trusted to you, who can
      never again be ignorant of the sound of evil words, and only owes it to
      God&rsquo;s mercy on his brave spirit that this has not been the beginning of
      destruction. I feel as if you had been trying to snatch away his soul!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And will you, can you not credit,&rsquo; said Gilbert, nearly inaudibly, &lsquo;that
      I did not act by my free will? I had no notion that any such thing could
      befall him, and would never have let them try to silence him, but to
      shield others.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Others! Yes, Archie Tritton and Algernon Dusautoy! I know what your
      free-will is in their hands, and yet I thought you cared for your brother
      enough to guard him, if not yourself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you knew the coercion,&rsquo; muttered Gilbert. &lsquo;I protest, as I would to my
      dying day, that I had no intention of going near the stables when I set
      out, and would never have consented could I have helped it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And why could not you help it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert gasped. &lsquo;Tritton brought me a message from Dusautoy, insisting on
      my meeting him there. It was too late to take Maurice home, and I could
      not send him with Archie. I expected only to exchange a few words at the
      door. It was Tritton who took Maurice away to the stables.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hear, but I do not see the compulsion, only the extraordinary weakness
      that leads you everywhere after those men.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I must tell you, I suppose,&rsquo; groaned Gilbert; &lsquo;I can bear anything but
      this. There&rsquo;s a miserable money entanglement that lays me under a certain
      obligation to Dusautoy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your father believed you had told him of all your debts,&rsquo; she said, in a
      tone of increased scorn and disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I did&mdash;I mean&mdash;Oh! Mrs. Kendal, believe me, I intended to have
      told him the utmost farthing&mdash;I thought I had done so&mdash;but this
      was a thing&mdash;Dusautoy had persuaded me into half consenting to have
      some wine with him from a cheating Portuguese&mdash;then ordered more than
      ever I knew of, and the man went and became bankrupt, and sent in a great
      abominable bill that I no more owned, nor had reason to expect than my
      horse.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So you preferred intriguing with this man to applying openly to your
      father?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was no doing of mine. It was forced upon me, and, in fact, the account
      was mixed up with his. It was the most evil hour of my life when I
      consented. I&rsquo;ve not had a moment&rsquo;s peace or happiness since, and it was
      the promise of the bill receipted that led me to this place.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And why was this place chosen for the meeting? You and Mr. Cavendish
      Dusautoy live only too near one another.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is not at the Vicarage,&rsquo; faltered Gilbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia suddenly grew pale with apprehension. &lsquo;Gilbert,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;there
      is only one thing that could make this business worse;&rsquo; and as she saw his
      change of countenance, she continued, &lsquo;Then it is so, and Lucy is his
      object.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He did not speak, but his face was that of a convicted traitor, and fresh
      perceptions crowded on her, as she exclaimed, horror struck, &lsquo;The ink!
      Yes, when you said she was with the Dusautoys! I understand! He has been
      in hiding, he has been here! And this expedition was to arrange a
      clandestine meeting between them under your father&rsquo;s own roof! You
      conniving! you who said you would sooner see your sister sold to Legree!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is all true,&rsquo; said Gilbert, moodily, his elbows on the table and his
      face in his hands, &lsquo;and if the utmost misery for weeks past could be any
      atonement, it would be mine. But at least I have done nothing willingly to
      bring them together. I have only gone on in the hope and trust that I was
      some protection to poor Lucy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fine protection,&rsquo; sighed Albinia. &lsquo;And how has it been? how does it
      stand?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, they met at Brighton, I believe. She used to walk on the chain pier
      before breakfast, and he met her there. If he chooses, he can make any one
      do what he likes, because he does not understand no for an answer. Then
      when she came home, he used to meet her on the bridge, when you sent her
      out for a turn in the evening, and sometimes she would make me take her
      out walking to meet him. Don&rsquo;t you see how utterly miserable it was for
      me; when they had volunteered this help all out of kindness, it was
      impossible for me to speak to you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia made a sound of contempt, and said, &lsquo;Go on.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That time when you and Mr. Hope saw them, Lucy was frightened, and they
      had a quarrel, he went away, and I hoped and trusted it had died out. I
      heard no more till yesterday, when I was dragged into giving him this
      meeting. It seems that he had only just discovered your absence, and
      wanted to take the opportunity of seeing her. I was in hopes you would
      have come back; I assured him you would; but he chose to watch, till
      evening, and then Lucy was to meet him in the conservatory. Poor Lucy, you
      must not be very angry with her, for she was much averse to it, and I
      enclosed a letter from her to forbid him to come. I thought all was safe,
      till I actually heard their voices, and grandmamma got into an agitation,
      and Sophy was running about wild to find Lucy. When you came home, papa&rsquo;s
      opening the door frightened Lucy, and it seems that Dusautoy thought that
      she was going to faint and scream, and laid hold of the ink instead of the
      eau-de-cologne. There! I believe the ink would have betrayed it without
      me. Now you have heard everything, Mrs. Kendal, and can believe there is
      not a more wretched and miserable creature breathing than I am.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia slowly rose, and put her hand to her brow, as though confused with
      the tissue of deceit and double dealing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! Mrs. Kendal, will you not speak to me?&rsquo; I solemnly declare that I
      have told you all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am thinking of your father.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With a gesture of acquiescent anguish and despair, he let her pass, held
      open the door, and closed it softly, so as not to awaken the happy
      sleeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good night,&rsquo; she said, coldly, and turned away, but his mournful,
      resigned &lsquo;Good night,&rsquo; was so utterly broken down that her heart was
      touched, and turning she said, &lsquo;Good night, Gilbert, I am sorry for you; I
      believe it is weakness and not wickedness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She held out her hand, but instead of being shaken, it was pressed to his
      lips, and the fingers were wet with his tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Feeling as though the bad dreams of a night had taken shape and life,
      Albinia stood by the fire in her sitting-room the next morning, trying to
      rally her judgment, and equally dreading the sight of those who had caused
      her grief, and of those who would share the shock she had last night
      experienced.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first knock announced one whom she did not expect&mdash;Gilbert,
      wretchedly pale from a sleepless night, and his voice scarcely audible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I beg your pardon,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;but I thought I might have led you to be
      hard on Lucy: I do believe it was against her will.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Before she could answer, the door flew wide, and in rushed Maurice,
      shouting, &lsquo;Good morning, mamma;&rsquo; and at his voice Mr. Kendal&rsquo;s
      dressing-room door was pushed back, and he called, &lsquo;Here, Maurice.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As the boy ran forward, he was met and lifted to his father&rsquo;s breast,
      while, with a fervency he little understood, though he never forgot it,
      the words were uttered,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;God bless you, Maurice, and give you grace to go on to withstand
      temptation, and speak the truth from your heart!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Maurice was impressed for a moment, then he recurred to his leading
      thought&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;May I have the cannon, papa? I did kick&mdash;I broke the bottle, but may
      I have the cannon?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Maurice, you are too young to understand the value of your resistance.
      Listen to me, my boy, for you must never forget this: you have been taken
      among persons who, I trust, will never be your companions.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; interrupted Maurice, &lsquo;must I never be a jockey?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, Maurice. Horses are perverted to bad purposes by thoughtless men, and
      you must keep aloof from such. You were not to blame, for you refused to
      do what you knew to be wrong, and did not know it was an improper place
      for you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gilbert took me,&rsquo; said Maurice, puzzled at the gravity, which convinced
      him that some one was in fault, and of course it must be himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gilbert did very wrong,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal, &lsquo;and henceforth you must learn
      that you must trust to your own conscience, and no longer believe that all
      your brother tells you is right.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Maurice gazed in inquiry, and perceiving his brother&rsquo;s downcast air, ran
      to his mother, crying, &lsquo;Is papa angry?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Gilbert, willing to spare her the pain of a reply, &lsquo;he is
      justly angry with me for having exposed you to temptation. Oh, Maurice, if
      I had been made such as you, it would have been better for us all!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the first perception that a grown person could do wrong, and that
      person his dear Gilbert. As if the grave countenances were insupportable,
      he gave a long-drawn breath, hid his face on his mother&rsquo;s knee, and burst
      into an agony of weeping. He was lifted on her lap in a moment, father and
      mother both comforting him with assurances that he was a very good boy,
      and that papa was much pleased with him, Mr. Kendal even putting the
      cannon into his hand, as a tangible evidence of favour; but the child
      thrust aside the toy, and sliding down, took hold of his brother&rsquo;s
      languid, dejected hand, and cried, with a sob and stamp of his foot,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You shan&rsquo;t say you are naughty: I wont let you!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas! it was a vain repulsion of the truth that this is a wicked world.
      Gilbert only put him back, saying,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You had better go away from me, Maurice: you cannot understand what I
      have done. Pray Heaven you may never know what I feel!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Maurice did but cling the tighter, and though Mr. Kendal had not yet
      addressed the culprit, he respected the force of that innocent love too
      much to interfere. The bell rang, and they went down, Maurice still
      holding by his brother, and when his uncle met them, it was touching to
      see the generous little fellow hanging back, and not giving his own hand
      till he had seen Gilbert receive the ordinary greeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though Mr. Ferrars had been told nothing, he could not but be aware of the
      symptoms of a family crisis&mdash;the gravity of some, and the pale, jaded
      looks of others. Lucy was not one of these; she came down with little
      Albinia in her arms, and began to talk rather airily, excusing herself for
      not having come down in the evening because that &lsquo;horrid ink&rsquo; had got into
      her hair, and tittering a little over the absurdity of her having picked
      up the inkstand in the dark. Not a word of response did she meet, and her
      gaiety died away in vague alarm. Sophy, the most innocent, looked
      wretched, and Maurice absolutely began to cry again, at the failure of
      some manoeuvre to make his father speak to Gilbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      His tears broke up the breakfast-party. His mother led him away to reason
      with him, that, sad as it was, it was better that people should be grieved
      when they had transgressed, as the only hope of their forgiveness and
      improvement. Maurice wanted her to reverse the declaration that Gilbert
      had done wrong; but, alas! this could not be, and she was obliged to send
      him out with his little sister, hoping that he would work off his grief by
      exercise. It was mournful to see the first shadow of the penalty of sin
      falling on the Eden of his childhood!
    </p>
    <p>
      With an aching heart, she went in search of Lucy, who had taken sanctuary
      in Mrs. Meadows&rsquo;s room, and was not easily withdrawn from thence to a
      tete-a-tete. Fearful of falsehood, Albinia began by telling her she knew
      all, and how little she had expected such a requital of trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy exclaimed that it had not been her fault, she had always wanted to
      tell, and gradually Albinia drew from her the whole avowal, half
      shamefaced, half exultant.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had never dreamt of meeting Algernon at Brighton&mdash;it was quite by
      chance that she came upon him at the officers&rsquo; ball when he was staying
      with Captain Greenaway. He asked her to dance, and she had said yes, all
      on a sudden, without thinking, and then she fancied he would go away; she
      begged him not to come again, but whenever she went out on the chain-pier
      before breakfast, there he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why did she go thither? She hung her head. Mrs. Annesley had desired her
      to walk; she could not help it; she was afraid to write and tell what was
      going on&mdash;besides, he would come, though she told him she would not
      see him; and she could not bear to make him unhappy. Then, when she came
      home, she had been in hopes it was all over, but she had been very
      unhappy, and had been on the point of telling all about it many times,
      when mamma looked at her kindly; but then he came to the Vicarage, and he
      would wait for her at the bridge, and write notes to her, and she could
      not stop it; but she had always told him it was no use, she never would be
      engaged to him without papa&rsquo;s consent. She had only promised that she
      would not marry any one else, only because he was so very desperate, and
      she was afraid to break it off entirely, lest he should go and marry the
      Principessa Bianca, a foreigner and Papist, which would be so shocking for
      him and his uncle. Gilbert could testify how grieved she was to have any
      secrets from mamma; but Mr. Cavendish Dusautoy was so dreadful when she
      talked of telling, that she did not know what would happen.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he went away, and she thought it was all over&mdash;mamma might
      recollect how hard it was for her to keep up, and what a force she put
      upon herself&mdash;but she would rather have pined to death than have said
      one word to bring him back, and was quite shocked when Gilbert gave her
      his note, to beg her to let him see her that evening, before the party
      returned; she said, with all her might, that he must not come, and when he
      did, she was begging him all the time to go away, and she was so
      dreadfully frightened when they actually came, that she had all but gone
      into hysterics, or fainted away, and that was the way he came to throw the
      ink at her&mdash;she was so very much shocked, and so would he be&mdash;and
      really she felt the misfortune to the beautiful new sofa-cover as a most
      serious calamity and aggravation of her offence.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not easy to know how to answer; Albinia was scornful of the
      sofa-cover, and yet it was hard to lay hold of a tangible subject on which
      to show Lucy her error, except in the concealment, which, by her own
      showing, she had lamented the whole time. She had always said no, but,
      unluckily, her noes were of the kind that might easily be made to mean
      yes, and she evidently had been led on partly by her own heart, partly by
      the force of the stronger will, though her better principles had filled
      her with scruples and misgivings at every stage. She had been often on the
      point of telling all, and asking forgiveness; and here it painfully
      crossed Albinia, that if she herself had been less hurried, and less
      disposed to take everything for granted, a little tenderness might have
      led to a voluntary confession.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still Lucy defended herself by the compulsion exercised on her, and she
      would hear none of the conclusions Albinia drew therefrom; she would not
      see that the man who drove her to a course of disobedience and subterfuge
      could be no fit guide, and fired up at a word of censure, declaring that
      she knew that mamma had always hated him, and that now he was absent, she
      would not hear him blamed. The one drop of true love made her difficult to
      deal with, for the heart was really made over to the tyrant, and Albinia
      did not feel herself sufficiently guiltless of negligence and imprudence
      to rebuke her with a comfortable conscience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kendal had been obliged to attend to some justice business&mdash;better
      for him, perhaps, than acting as domestic magistrate&mdash;and meanwhile
      the Vicar of Fairmead found himself forgotten. He wanted to be at home,
      yet did not like to leave his sister in unexplained trouble, though not
      sure whether he might not be better absent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Time passed on, he finished the newspaper, and wrote letters, and then,
      seeing no one, he had gone into the hall to send for a conveyance, when
      Gilbert, coming in from the militia parade, became the recipient of his
      farewells, but apparently with so little comprehension, that he broke off,
      struck by the dejected countenance, and wandering eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I beg your pardon,&rsquo; Gilbert said, passing his hand over his brow, &lsquo;I did
      not hear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was only asking you to tell my sister that I would not disturb her, and
      leaving my good-byes with you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are not going?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you; I think my wife will grow anxious.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I had hoped&rsquo;&mdash;Gilbert sighed and paused&mdash;&lsquo;I had thought that
      perhaps&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The wretchedness of his tone drove away Mr. Ferrars&rsquo;s purpose of immediate
      departure, and returning to the drawing-room he said, &lsquo;If there were any
      way in which I could be of use.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you do not know?&rsquo; said Gilbert, veiling his face with his hand, as
      he leant on the mantel-shelf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know nothing. I could only see that something was amiss. I was wishing
      to know whether my presence or absence would be best for you all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! don&rsquo;t go!&rsquo; cried Gilbert. Nobody must go who can be any comfort to
      Mrs. Kendal.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A few kind words drew forth the whole piteous history that lay so heavily
      on his heart. Reserves were all over now; and irregularly and incoherently
      he laid open his griefs and errors, his gradual absorption into the
      society with which he had once broken, and the inextricable complication
      of mischief in which he had been involved by his debt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yet,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;all the time I longed from my heart to do well. It was
      the very thing that led me into this scrape. I thought if the man applied
      to my father, as he threatened, that I should be suspected of having
      concealed this on purpose, and be sent to India, and I was so happy, and
      thought myself so safe here. I did believe that home and Mrs. Kendal would
      have sheltered me, but my destiny must needs hunt me out here, and
      alienate even her!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The way to find the Devil behind the Cross, is to cower beneath it in
      weak idolatry, instead of grasping it in courageous faith,&rsquo; said Mr.
      Ferrars. &lsquo;Such faith would have made you trust yourself implicitly to your
      father. Then you would either have gone forth in humble acceptance of the
      punishment, or else have stayed at home, free, pardoned, and guarded; but,
      as it was, no wonder temptation followed you, and you had no force to
      resist it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And so all is lost! Even dear little Maurice can never be trusted to me
      again! And his mother, who would, if she could, be still merciful and
      pitying as an angel, she cannot forget to what I exposed him! She will
      never be the same to me again! Yet I could lay down my life for any of
      them!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ferrars watched the drooping figure, crouching on his chairs, elbows
      on knees, head bowed on the supporting hands, and face hidden, and,
      listening to the meek, affectionate hopelessness of the tone, he
      understood the fond love and compassion that had often surprised him in
      his sister, but he longed to read whether this were penitence towards God,
      or remorse towards man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Miserable indeed, Gilbert,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;but if all were irretrievably
      offended, there still is One who can abundantly pardon, where repentance
      is true.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thought&rsquo;&mdash;cried Gilbert&mdash;&lsquo;I thought it had been true before!
      If pain, and shame, and abhorrence could so render it, I know it was when
      I came home. And then it was comparative happiness; I thought I was
      forgiven, I found joy and peace where they are promised&rsquo;&mdash;the burning
      tears dropped between his fingers&mdash;but it was all delusion; not
      prayers nor sacraments can shield me&mdash;I am doomed, and all I ask is
      to be out of the way of ruining Maurice!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is mere despair,&rsquo; said Mr. Ferrars. &lsquo;I cannot but believe your
      contrition was sincere; but steadfast courage was what you needed, and you
      failed in the one trial that may have been sent you to strengthen and
      prove you. The effects have been terrible, but there is every hope that
      you may retrieve your error, and win back the sense of forgiveness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I could dare to hope so&mdash;but I cannot presume to take home to
      myself those assurances, when I know that I only resolve, that I may have
      resolutions to break.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you ever laid all this personally before Mr. Dusautoy?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No; I have thought of it, but, mixed up as this is with his nephew and my
      sister, it is impossible! But you are a clergyman, Mr. Ferrars!&rsquo; he added,
      eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ferrars thought, and then said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you wish it, Gilbert, I will gladly do what I can for you. I believe
      that I may rightly do so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His face gleamed for a moment with the light of grateful gladness, as if
      at the first ray of comfort, and then he said, &lsquo;I am sure none was ever
      more grieved and wearied with the burden of sin&mdash;if that be all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think,&rsquo; said Mr. Ferrars, &lsquo;that it might be better to give time to
      collect yourself, examine the past, separate the sorrow for the sin from
      the disgrace of the consequences, and then look earnestly at the sole
      ground of hope. How would it be to come for a couple of nights to
      Fairmead, at the end of next week?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert gratefully caught at the invitation; and Mr. Ferrars gave him some
      advice as to his reading and self-discipline, speaking to him as gently
      and tenderly as Albinia herself. Both lingered in case the other should
      have more to say, but at last Gilbert stood up, saying,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I would thankfully go to Calcutta now, but the situation is filled up,
      and my father said John Kendal had been enough trifled with. If I saw any
      fresh opening, where I should be safe from hurting Maurice!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is no reason you and your brother should not be a blessing to each
      other.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, there is. Till I lived at home, I did not know how impossible it is
      to keep clear of old acquaintance. They are good-natured fellows&mdash;that
      Tritton and the like&mdash;and after all that has come and gone, one would
      be a brute to cut them entirely, and Maurice is always after me, and has
      been more about with them than his mother knows. Even if I were very
      different, I should be a link, and though it might be no great harm if
      Maurice were a tame mamma&rsquo;s boy&mdash;you see, being the fellow he is, up
      to anything for a lark, and frantic about horses&mdash;I could never keep
      him from them. There&rsquo;s no such great harm in themselves&mdash;hearty,
      good-natured fellows they are&mdash;but there&rsquo;s a worse lot that they
      meet, and Maurice will go all lengths whenever he begins. Now, so little
      as he is now, if I were once gone, he would never run into their way, and
      they would never get a hold of him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ferrars had unconsciously screwed up his face with dismay, but he
      relaxed it, and spoke kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are right. It was a mistake to stay at home. Perhaps your regiment
      may be stationed elsewhere.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know how long it may be called out. If it were but possible to
      make a fresh beginning.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did you hear of my brother&rsquo;s suggestion?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish&mdash;but it is useless to talk about that. I could not presume to
      ask my father for a commission&mdash;Heaven knows when I shall dare to
      speak to him!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have not personally asked his pardon after full confession.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;N-o&mdash;Mrs. Kendal knows all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did you ever do such a thing in your life?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t know what my father is.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Neither do you, Gilbert. Let that be the first token of sincerity.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Without leaving space for another word, Mr. Ferrars went through the
      conservatory into the garden, where, meeting the children, he took the
      little one in his arms, and sent Maurice to fetch his mamma. Albinia came
      down, looking so much heated and harassed, that he was grieved to leave
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, Maurice, I am sorry! You always come in for some catastrophe,&rsquo; she
      said, trying to smile. &lsquo;You have had a most forlorn morning.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gilbert has been with me,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;He has told me all, my dear, and I
      think it hopeful: I like him better than I ever did before.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor feather, the breath of your lips has blown him the other way,&rsquo; said
      Albinia, too unhappy for consolation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, it seems to me that you have done more for him than I ever quite
      believed. I did not expect such sound, genuine religious feeling.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He always had plenty of religious sentiment,&rsquo; said Albinia, sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have asked him to come to us next week. Will you tell Edmund so?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. He will be thankful to you for taking him in hand. Poor boy, I know
      how attractive his penitence is, but I have quite left off building on
      it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ferrars defended him no longer. He could not help being much moved by
      the youth&rsquo;s self-abasement, but that might be only because it was new to
      him, and he did not even try to recommend him to her mercy; he knew her
      own heart might be trusted to relent, and it would not hurt Gilbert in the
      end to be made to feel the full weight of his offence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I must go,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;though I am sorry to leave you in perplexity. I am
      afraid I can do nothing for you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing&mdash;but feel kindly to Gilbert,&rsquo; said Albinia. &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t do so
      yet. I don&rsquo;t feel as if I ever could again, when I think what he was doing
      with Maurice. Yes, and how easily he could have brought poor Lucy to her
      senses, if he had been good for anything! Oh! Maurice, this is sickening
      work! You should be grateful to me for not scolding you for having taken
      me from home!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do not repent,&rsquo; said her brother. &lsquo;The explosion is better than the
      subterranean mining.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It may be,&rsquo; said Albinia, &lsquo;and I need not boast of the good I did at
      home! My poor, poor Lucy! A little discreet kindness and watchfulness on
      my part would have made all the difference! It was all my running my own
      way with my eyes shut, but then, I had always lived with trustworthy
      people. Well, I wont keep you listening to my maundering, when Winifred
      wants you. Oh! why did that Polysyllable ever come near the place?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ferrars said the kindest and most cheering things he could devise, and
      drove away, not much afraid of her being unforgiving.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was disposed to stake all his hopes of the young man on the issue of
      his advice to make a direct avowal to his father. And Gilbert made the
      effort, though rather in desperation than resolution, knowing that his
      condition could not be worse, and seeing no hope save in Mr. Ferrars&rsquo; 
      counsel. He was the first to seek Mr. Kendal, and dreadful to him as was
      the unaltering melancholy displeasure of the fixed look, the steadily
      penetrating deep dark eyes, and the subdued sternness of the voice, he
      made his confession fully, without reserve or palliation.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was more than Mr. Kendal had expected, and more, perhaps, than he
      absolutely trusted, for Gilbert had not hitherto inspired faith in his
      protestations that he spoke the whole truth and nothing but the truth, nor
      had he always the power of doing so when overpowered by fright. The manner
      in which his father laid hold of any inadvertent discrepancy, treating it
      as a wilful prevarication, was terror and agony; and well as he knew it to
      be the meed of past equivocation, he felt it cruel to torture him by
      implied suspicion. Yet how could it be otherwise, when he had been
      introducing his little brother to his own corrupters, and conniving at his
      sister&rsquo;s clandestine correspondence with a man whom he knew to be
      worthless?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The grave words that he obtained at last, scarcely amounted to pardon;
      they implied that he had done irreparable mischief and acted
      disgracefully, and such forgiveness as was granted was only made
      conditional on there being no farther reserves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas! even with all tender love and compassion, no earthly parent can
      forgive as does the Heavenly Father. None but the Omniscient can test the
      fulness of the confession, nor the sincerity of &lsquo;Father, I have sinned
      against Heaven and before Thee, and am no more worthy to be called Thy
      son.&rsquo; This interview only sent the son away more crushed and overwhelmed,
      and yearning towards the more deeply offended, and yet more compassionate
      Father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kendal, after this interview, so far relaxed his displeasure as to
      occasionally address Gilbert when they met at luncheon after this
      deplorable morning, while towards Lucy he observed a complete silence. It
      was not at first that she perceived this, and even then it struck more
      deeply on Sophia than it did on her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kendal shrank from inflicting pain on the good vicar, and it was
      decided that the wives should be the channel through which the information
      should be imparted. Albinia took the children, sending them to play in the
      garden while she talked to Mrs. Dusautoy. She found that keen little lady
      had some shrewd suspicions, but had discovered nothing defined enough to
      act upon, and was relieved to have the matter opened at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the ink, no mortal could help laughing over it; even Albinia, who
      had been feeling as if she could never laugh again, was suddenly struck by
      the absurdity, and gave way to a paroxysm of merriment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Properly managed, I do think it might put an end to the whole affair,&rsquo; 
      said Mrs. Dusautoy. &lsquo;He could not stand being laughed at.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid he never will believe that he can be laughed at.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, that is unlucky,&rsquo; said Mrs. Dusautoy, gravely; but recollecting that
      she was not complimentary, she added, &lsquo;You must not think we undervalue
      Lucy. John is very fond of her, and the only objection is, that it would
      require a person of more age and weight to deal with Algernon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never mind speeches,&rsquo; sighed Albinia; &lsquo;we know too well that nothing
      could be worse for either. Can&rsquo;t you give him a tutor and send him to
      travel.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll talk to John; but unluckily he is of age next month, and there&rsquo;s an
      end of our power. And John would never keep him away from hence, for he
      thinks it his only chance.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose we must do something with Lucy. Heigh-ho! People used not to be
      always falling in love in my time, except Fred, and that was in a rational
      way; that could be got rid of!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The effect of the intelligence on the vicar was to make him set out at
      once to the livery-stables in quest of his nephew, but he found that the
      young gentleman had that morning started for London, whither he proposed
      to follow him on the Monday. Lucy cried incessantly, in the fear that the
      gentle-hearted vicar might have some truculent intentions towards his
      nephew, and was so languid and unhappy that no one had the heart to scold
      her; and comforting her was still more impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kendal used to stride away from the sight of her swollen eyes, and ask
      Albinia why she did not tell her that the only good thing that could
      happen to her would be, that she should never see nor hear of the fellow
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why he did not tell her so himself was a different question.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, Albinia,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal, after seeing Mr. Dusautoy on his return
      from London.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was such a look of deprecation about him, that she exclaimed, &lsquo;One
      would really think you had been accepting this charming son-in-law.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Suppose I had,&rsquo; he said, rather quaintly; then, as he saw her hands held
      up, &lsquo;conditionally, you understand, entirely conditionally. What could I
      do, when Dusautoy entreated me, with tears in his eyes, not to deprive him
      of the only chance of saving his nephew?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Umph,&rsquo; was the most innocent sound Albinia could persuade herself to
      make.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Besides,&rsquo; continued Mr. Kendal, &lsquo;it will be better to have the affair
      open and avowed than to have all this secret plotting going on without
      being able to prevent it. I can always withhold my consent if he should
      not improve, and Dusautoy declares nothing would be such an incentive.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;May it prove so!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You see,&rsquo; he pursued, &lsquo;as his uncle says, nothing can be worse than
      driving him to these resorts, and when he is once of age, there&rsquo;s an end
      of all power over him to hinder his running straight to ruin. Now, when he
      is living at the Vicarage, we shall have far more opportunity of knowing
      how he is going on, and putting a check on their intercourse, if he be
      unsatisfactory.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If we can.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;After all, the young man has done nothing that need blight his future
      life. He has had great disadvantages, and his steady attachment is much in
      his favour. His uncle tells me he promises to become all that we could
      wish, and, in that case, I do not see that I have the right to refuse the
      offer, when things have gone so far&mdash;conditionally, of course.&rsquo; He
      dwelt on that saving clause like a salve for his misgivings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what is to become of Gilbert and Maurice, with him always about the
      house?&rsquo; exclaimed Albinia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We will take care he is not too much here. He will soon be at Oxford.
      Indeed, my dear, I am sorry you disapprove. I should have been as glad to
      avoid the connexion as you could be, but I do not think I had any
      alternative, when Mr. Dusautoy pressed me so warmly, and only asked that
      he should be taken on probation; and besides, when poor Lucy&rsquo;s affections
      are so decidedly involved.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia perceived that there had been temper in her tone, and could object
      no further, since it was too late, and as she could not believe that her
      husband had been weak, she endeavoured to acquiesce in his reasoning, and
      it was a strong argument that they should see Lucy bright again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;that you would prefer that I should announce my
      decision to her myself!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a more welcome task than spreading gloom over her countenance, but
      she entered in great trepidation, prepared to sink under some stern
      mandate, and there was nothing at first to undeceive her, for her father
      was resolved to atone for his concession by sparing her no preliminary
      thunders, and began by depicting her indiscretion and deceit, as well as
      the folly of attaching herself to a man without other recommendations than
      figure and fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      How much Lucy heard was uncertain; she leant on a chair with drooping head
      and averted face, trembling, and suppressing a sob, apparently too much
      frightened to attend. Just when the exordium was over, and &lsquo;Therefore I
      lay my commands on you&rsquo; might have been expected, it turned into,
      &lsquo;However, upon Mr. Dusautoy&rsquo;s kind representation, I have resolved to give
      the young man a trial, and provided he convinces me by his conduct that I
      may safely entrust your happiness to him, I have told his uncle that I
      will not withhold my sanction.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With a shriek of irrepressible feeling, Lucy looked from father to mother,
      and clasped her hands, unable to trust her ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, Lucy,&rsquo; said Albinia, &lsquo;your father consents, on condition that
      nothing further happens to excite his doubts of Mr. Cavendish Dusautoy. It
      rests with yourself now, it is not too late. After all that has passed,
      you would incur much deserved censure if you put an end to the affair; but
      even that would be better, far better, than entering into an engagement
      with a man without sound principle.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your mother is quite right, Lucy,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal. &lsquo;This is the only
      time. Gratified vanity has led you too far, and you have acted as I hoped
      no child of mine would ever act, but you have not forfeited our tenderest
      care. You are not engaged to this man, and no word of yours would be
      broken. If you hesitate to commit yourself to him, you have only to speak,
      and we would gladly at once do everything that could conduce to make you
      happy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t want me to give him up!&rsquo; cried Lucy. &lsquo;Oh! mamma, did not he say
      he had consented?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I said it rested with yourself Lucy. Do not answer me now. Come to me at
      six o&rsquo;clock, and tell me, after full reflection, whether I am to consider
      you as ready to pledge yourself to this young man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was all that could be done. Albinia had a dim hope that the sense of
      responsibility, and dread of that hard will and selfish temper, might so
      rise upon Lucy as to startle her, but then, as Mr. Kendal observed, if she
      should decide against him, she would have used him so extremely ill, that
      they should feel nothing but shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Albinia, &lsquo;but it would be better to be ashamed of a girl&rsquo;s
      folly, than to see her made miserable for life. Poor Lucy! if she decide
      against him, she will become a woman at once, if not, I&rsquo;m afraid it will
      be the prediction about Marie Antoinette over again&mdash;very gay, and
      coming right through trial.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They were obliged to tell Sophy of the state of things. She stood up
      straight, and said, slowly and clearly, &lsquo;I do not like the world at all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t quite see what you mean.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Every one does what can&rsquo;t be helped, and it is not <i>the</i> thing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Explain yourself, Sophy,&rsquo; said her father, amused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think Lucy ought to be making the decision at all,&rsquo; said Sophy.
      She did that long ago, when first, she attended to what he said to her. If
      she does not take him now, it will be swearing to her neighbour, and
      disappointing him, because it is to her own hindrance.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, Sophy; but I believe it is better to incur the sin of breaking a
      promise, than to go on when the fulfilment involves not only suffering,
      but mischief. Lucy has repeatedly declared there was no engagement.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know it could not be helped; but Mr. Dusautoy ought not to have asked
      papa.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nor papa to have consented, my Suleiman ben Daood,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal. &lsquo;Ah!
      Sophy, we all have very clear, straightforward views at eighteen of what
      other people ought to do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Papa&mdash;I never meant&mdash;I did not think I was saying anything
      wrong. I only said I did not like the world.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I heartily agree with you, Sophy, and if I had lived in it as short a
      time as you have, perhaps &ldquo;considerations&rdquo; would not affect my judgment.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am always telling Sophy she will be more merciful as she grows older,&rsquo; 
      said Albinia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If it were only being more merciful, it would be very well,&rsquo; said Mr.
      Kendal; &lsquo;but one also becomes less thorough-going, because practice is
      more painful than theory, and one remembers consequences that have made
      themselves felt. It is just as well that there should be young people to
      put us in mind what our flights once were.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia and Sophy left Lucy to herself; they both wished to avoid the
      useless &lsquo;What shall I do?&rsquo; and they thought that, driven back on her own
      resources, even <i>her</i> own mind might give her better counsel than the
      seven watchmen aloft in a high tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came down looking exceedingly pale. Mr. Kendal regarded her anxiously,
      and held his hand out to her kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Papa,&rsquo; she said, simply, &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t give it up. I do love him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well, my dear,&rsquo; he answered, &lsquo;there is no more to be said than that
      I trust he will merit your affection and make you happy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Good Mr. Dusautoy was as happy as a king; he took Lucy in his arms, and
      kissed her as if she had been his child, and with her hands folded in his
      own, he told her how she was to teach his dear Algernon to be everything
      that was good, and to lead him right by her influence. She answered with
      caresses and promises, and whoever had watched her eye, would have seen it
      in a happy day-dream of Algernon&rsquo;s perfection, and his uncle thanking her
      for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had expected that grandmamma would have been very happy; but marriage
      had, with the poor old lady, led to so much separation, that her weakened
      faculties took the alarm, and she received the tidings by crying bitterly,
      and declaring that every one was going away and leaving her. Lucy assured
      her over and over again that she was never going to desert her, and as Mr.
      Kendal had made it a condition that Algernon should finish his Oxford
      career respectably, there was little chance that poor Mrs. Meadows would
      survive until the marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      All along Gilbert made no remark. Though he had been left out of the
      family conclaves, and his opinion not asked, he submitted with the utmost
      meekness, as one who knew that he had forfeited all right to be treated as
      son and heir. The more he was concerned at the engagement, the greater
      stigma he would place on his own connivance; so he said nothing, and only
      devoted himself to his grandmother, as though the attendance upon her were
      a refuge and relief. More gentle and patient than ever, he soothed her
      fretfulness, invented pleasures for her, and rendered her so placid and
      contented, that her health began to improve.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not for a moment did he seem to forget his error; and Albinia&rsquo;s resolution
      to separate Maurice from him, could not hold when he himself silently
      assumed the mournful necessity, and put the child from him when clamorous
      for rides, till there was an appeal to papa and mamma. Mr. Kendal gave one
      look of inquiry at Albinia, and she began some matter-of-course about
      Gilbert being so kind&mdash;whereupon the brothers were together as
      before. When Albinia visited her little boy at night, she found that
      Gilbert had been talking to him of his eldest brother, and she heard more
      of Edmund&rsquo;s habits and tastes from the little fellow who had never seen
      him, than from either the twin-brother or the sister who had loved him so
      devotedly. It was as if Gilbert knew that he could be doing Maurice no
      harm when leading him to think of Edmund, and perhaps he felt some
      intrinsic resemblance in the deep loving strength of the two natures.
    </p>
    <p>
      The invitation to Fairmead spared him the pain and shame of Algernon
      Dusautoy&rsquo;s first reception as Lucy&rsquo;s accepted lover. He went early on
      Saturday morning, and young Dusautoy, arriving in the evening, was first
      ushered into the library; while Albinia did her best to soothe the excited
      nerves and fluttering spirits of Lucy, who was exceedingly ashamed to meet
      him again under the eyes of others, after such a course of stolen
      interviews, and what she had been told of her influence doing him good
      only alarmed her the more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well she might, for if ever character resembled that of the iron pot borne
      down the stream in company with the earthen one, it was the object of her
      choice. Poor pipkin that Gilbert was, the contact had cost him a smashing
      blow, and for all clay of the more fragile mould, the best hope was to
      give the invulnerable material a wide berth. Talk of influence! Mr.
      Dusautoy might as well hope that a Wedgwood cream-jug would guide a copper
      cauldron and keep verdigris aloof.
    </p>
    <p>
      His attraction for Lucy had always been a mystery to her family, who
      perhaps hardly did justice to the magnetism of mere force of purpose.
      Better training might have ennobled into resolution that which was now
      doggedness and obstinacy, and, even in that shape, the real element of
      strength had a tendency to work upon softer natures. Thus it had acted in
      different ways with the Vicar, with Gilbert, and with Lucy; each had
      fallen under the power of his determination, with more or less of their
      own consent, and with Lucy the surrender was complete; she no sooner sat
      beside Algernon than she was completely his possession, and his complacent
      self-satisfaction was reflected on her face in a manner that told her
      parents that she was their own no longer, but given up to a stronger
      master.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia liked neither to see nor to think about it, and kept aloof as much
      as she could, dividing herself between grandmamma and the children. On
      Tuesday morning, during Maurice&rsquo;s lessons, there was a knock at the
      sitting-room door. She expected Gilbert, but was delighted to see her
      brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thought you were much too busy to come near us?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So I am; I can&rsquo;t stay; so if Kendal be not forthcoming you must give this
      fellow a holiday.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is gone to Hadminster, so&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s Gilbert?&rsquo; broke in little Maurice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He went to his room to dress to go up to parade,&rsquo; said Mr. Ferrars, and
      off rushed the boy without waiting for permission.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia sighed, and said, &lsquo;It is a perfect passion.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t mourn over it. Love is too good a thing to be lamented over, and
      this may turn into a blessing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I used to be proud of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So you shall be still. I am very much pleased with that poor lad.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She would not raise her eyes, she was weary of hoping for Gilbert, and his
      last offence had touched her where she had never been touched before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Whatever faults he has,&rsquo; Mr. Ferrars said, &lsquo;I am much mistaken if his
      humility, love, and contrition be not genuine, and what more can the best
      have?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sincerity!&rsquo; said Albinia, hopelessly. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s no truth in him!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You should discriminate between deliberate self-interested deception, and
      failure in truth for want of moral courage. Both are bad enough, but the
      latter is not &ldquo;loving a lie,&rdquo; not such a ruinous taint and evidence of
      corruption as the former.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is curious to hear you repeating my old excuses for him,&rsquo; said
      Albinia, &lsquo;now that he has cast his glamour over you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not wrongly,&rsquo; said her brother. &lsquo;He is in earnest; there is no acting
      about him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, that I believe; I know he loves us with all his heart, poor boy,
      especially Maurice and me, and I think he had rather go right than wrong,
      if he could only be let alone. But, oh! it is all &ldquo;unstable as water.&rdquo; Am
      I unkind, Maurice? I know how it would be if I let him talk to me for ten
      minutes, or look at me with those pleading brown eyes of his!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ferrars knew it well, and why she was steeled against him, but he put
      this aside, saying that he was come to speak of the future, not of the
      past, and that he wanted Edmund to reconsider William&rsquo;s advice. He told
      her what Gilbert had said of the difficulty of breaking off old
      connexions, and the danger to Maurice from his acquaintance. An exchange
      into another corps of militia might be for the worse, the occupation was
      uncertain, and Mr. Ferrars believed that a higher position, companions of
      a better stamp, and the protection of a man of lively manners, quick
      sympathy, and sound principle, like their cousin Fred, might be the
      opening of a new life. He had found Gilbert most desirous of such a step,
      regarding it as his only hope, but thinking it so offensively presumptuous
      to propose it to his father under present circumstances, his Oxford terms
      thrown away, and himself disgraced both there and at home, that the matter
      would hardly have been brought forward had not Mr. Ferrars undertaken to
      press it, under the strong conviction that remaining at home would be
      destruction, above all, with young Dusautoy making part of the family.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I declare,&rsquo; said Mr. Ferrars, &lsquo;he looked so much at home in the
      drawing-room, and welcomed Gilbert with such an air of patronage, that I
      could have found it in my heart to have knocked him down!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a treat to hear Maurice speak so unguardedly, and Albinia laughed,
      and asked whether he thought it very wrong to hope that the Polysyllable
      would yet do something flagrant enough to open Lucy&rsquo;s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll allow you to hope that <i>if</i> he should, her eyes <i>may</i> be
      opened,&rsquo; said Maurice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia began a vehement vindication for their having tolerated the
      engagement, in the midst of which her brother was obliged to depart,
      amused at her betrayal of her own sentiments by warfare against what he
      had never said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had treated his counsel as chimerical, but when she repeated it to her
      husband, she thought better of it, since, alas! it had become her great
      object to part those two loving brothers. Mr. Kendal first asked where the
      25th Lancers were, then spoke of expense, and inquired what she knew of
      the cost of commissions, and of her cousin&rsquo;s means. All she could answer
      for was, that Fred&rsquo;s portion was much smaller than Gilbert&rsquo;s inheritance,
      but at least she knew how to learn what was wanted, and if her friends,
      the old Generals, were to be trusted, she ought to have no lack of
      interest at the Horse Guards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert was taken into counsel, and showed so much right spirit and good
      sense, that the discussion was friendly and unreserved. It ended in the
      father and son resorting to Pettilove&rsquo;s office to ascertain the amount of
      ready money in his hands, and what income Gilbert would receive on coming
      of age. The investigation somewhat disappointed the youth, who had never
      thoroughly credited what his father told him of the necessity of his
      exerting himself for his own maintenance, nor understood how heavy a drain
      on his property were the life-interests of his father and grandmother, and
      the settlement on his aunt. By-and-by, he might be comparatively a rich
      man, but at first his present allowance would be little more than doubled,
      and the receipts would be considerably diminished by an alteration of
      existing system of rents, such as had so long been planned. It was plain
      that the almshouses were the unsubstantial fabric of a dream, but no one
      now dared to refer to them, and Mr. Kendal desired Albinia to write to
      consult her cousin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Ferrars was so much flattered at her asking his protection for
      anything, that he would have promised to patronize Cousin Slender himself
      for her sake. He praised the Colonel and lauded the mess to the skies, and
      economy being his present hobby, he represented himself as living upon
      nothing, and saving his pay. He further gave notice of impending
      retirements, and advised that the application should be made without loss
      of time, lamenting grievously himself that there was no chance for the
      25th, of a touch at the Russians.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something in his letter put every one into a hurry, and a correspondence
      began, which resulted in Gilbert&rsquo;s being summoned to Sandhurst for an
      examination, which he passed creditably. The purchase-money was deposited,
      and the household was daily thrown into a state of excitement by the
      arrival of official-looking envelopes, which turned out to contain
      solicitations from tailors and outfitters, bordered with portraits of
      camp-beds and portable baths, until, at last, when the real document
      appeared, Gilbert tossed it aside as from &lsquo;another tailor:&rsquo; but Albinia
      knew the article too well to mistake it, and when the long blue cover was
      opened, it proved to convey more than they had reckoned upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert Kendal held a commission in the 25th Lancers, and the corps was
      under immediate orders for the East. The number of officers being
      deficient, he was to join the headquarters at Cork, without going to the
      depot, and would thence sail with a stated minimum of baggage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia could not look up. She knew her husband had not intended thus to
      risk the last of his eldest-born sons; and though her soldier-spirit might
      have swelled with exultation had her own brave boy been concerned, she
      dreaded the sight of quailing or dismay in Gilbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Going really to fight the Russians,&rsquo; shouted Maurice, as the meaning
      reached him. &lsquo;Oh! Gibbie, if I was but a man to go with you!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will do your duty, my boy,&rsquo; said his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By God&rsquo;s help,&rsquo; was the reverent answer which emboldened Albinia to look
      up at him, as he stood with Maurice clinging by both hands to him. She had
      done him injustice, and her heart bounded at the sight of the flush on his
      cheek, the light in his eyes, and the expression on his lips, making his
      face finer and more manly than she had ever seen it, as if the grave
      necessity, and the awe of the unseen glorious danger, were fixing and
      elevating his wandering purpose. To have no choice was a blessing to an
      infirm will, and to be inevitably out of his own power braced him and gave
      him rest. She held out her hand to him, and there was a grasp of
      inexpressible feeling, the first renewal of their old terms of sympathy
      and confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no time to be lost; Mr. Kendal would go to London with him by
      the last train that day, to fit him out as speedily as possible, before he
      started for Cork.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every one felt dizzy, and there was no space for aught but action. Perhaps
      Albinia was glad of the hurry, she could not talk to Gilbert till she had
      learnt to put faith in him, and she would rather do him substantial
      kindnesses than be made the sharer of feelings that had too often proved
      like the growth of the seed which found no depth of earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      She ran about for him, worked for him, contrived for him, and gave him
      directions; she could not, or would not, perceive his yearning for an
      effusion of penitent tenderness. He looked wistfully at her when he was
      setting out to take leave at the Vicarage, but she had absorbed herself in
      flannel shirts, and would not meet his eye, nor did he venture to make the
      request that she would come with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, confidences there could be but few, for Maurice and Albinia hung
      on either side of him, so that he could hardly move, but he resisted all
      attempt to free him even from the little girl, who was hardly out of his
      arms for ten minutes together. It was only from her broken words that her
      mother understood that from the vicarage he had gone to the church. Poor
      little Albinia did not like it at all. &lsquo;Why was brother Edmund up in the
      church, and why did Gilbert cry?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Maurice angrily enunciated, &lsquo;Men never cry,&rsquo; but not a word of the visit
      to the church came from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Algernon Dusautoy had wisely absented himself, and the two sisters devoted
      themselves to the tasks in hand. Sophy worked as hard as did Mrs. Kendal,
      and spoke even less, and Lucy took care of Mrs. Meadows, whose nerves were
      painfully excited by the bustle in the house. It had been agreed that she
      should not hear of her grandson&rsquo;s intention till the last moment, and then
      he went in, putting on a cheerful manner, to bid her good-bye, only
      disclosing that he was going to London, but little as she could
      understand, there was an instinct about her that could not be deceived,
      and she began to cry helplessly and violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Kendal and Lucy were summoned in haste; Gilbert lingered, trying to
      help them to restore her to composure. But time ran short; his father
      called him, and they hardly knew that they had received his last hurried
      embrace, nor that he was really gone, till they heard Maurice shouting
      like a Red Indian, as he careered about in the garden, his only resource
      against tears; and Sophy came in very still, very pale, and incapable of
      uttering a word or shedding a tear. Albinia was much concerned, for she
      could not bear to have sent him away without a more real adieu, and word
      of blessing and good augury; it made her feel herself truly unforgiving,
      and perhaps turned her heart back to him more fully and fondly than any
      exchange of sentiment would have done. But she had not much time to dwell
      on this omission, for poor Mrs. Meadows missed him sorely, and after two
      days&rsquo; constant fretting after him, another paralytic stroke renewed the
      immediate danger, so that by the time Mr. Kendal returned from London she
      was again hovering between life and death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kendal, to his great joy, met Frederick Ferrars at the &lsquo;Family
      Office.&rsquo; The changes in the regiment had given him his majority, and he
      had flashed over from Ireland to make his preparations for the campaign.
      His counsel had been most valuable in Gilbert&rsquo;s equipment, especially in
      the knotty question of horses, and he had shown himself so amiable and
      rational that Mr. Kendal was quite delighted, and rejoiced in committing
      Gilbert to his care. He had assumed the trust in a paternal manner, and,
      infected by his brilliant happiness and hopefulness, Gilbert had gone off
      to Ireland in excellent spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Another thing conduced to cheer him,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal afterwards to his
      wife, with a tone that caused her to exclaim, &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t mean that he saw
      Genevieve?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are right. We came upon her in Rivington&rsquo;s shop, while we were
      looking for the smallest Bible. I saw who it was chiefly by his change of
      colour, and I confess I kept out of the way. The whole did not last five
      minutes; she had her pupils with her, and soon went away; but he thanked
      me, and took heart from that moment. Poor boy, who would have thought the
      impression would have been so lasting?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, by the time he is a field-officer, even William will let him please
      himself,&rsquo; said Albinia, lightly, because her heart was too full for her to
      speak seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      She tried, by a kind letter, to atone for the omitted farewell, and it
      seemed to cheer and delight Gilbert. He wrote from Cork as if he had
      imbibed fresh hope and enterprise from his new companions, he liked them
      all, and could not say enough of the kindness of Major Ferrars. Everything
      went smoothly, and in the happiest frame he sailed from Cork, and was
      heard of again at Malta and Gallipoli, direfully sea-sick, but reviving to
      write most amusing long descriptive letters, and when he reached the camp
      at Yarna, he reported as gratefully of General Ferrars as the General did
      kindly of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those letters were the chief pleasures in a harassing spring and summer.
      It was well that practice had trained Sophia in the qualities of a nurse,
      for Lucy was seldom available when Algernon Dusautoy was at home; she was
      sure to be riding with him, or sitting for her picture, or the good Vicar,
      afraid of her overworking herself, insisted on her spending the evening at
      the vicarage.
    </p>
    <p>
      She yielded, but not with an easy conscience, to judge by her numerous
      apologies, and when Mr. Cavendish Dusautoy returned to Oxford, she devoted
      herself with great assiduity to the invalid. Her natural gifts were far
      more efficient than Sophy&rsquo;s laboriously-earned gentleness, and her
      wonderful talent for prattling about nothing had a revivifying influence,
      sparing much of the plaintive weariness which accompanied that mournful
      descent of life&rsquo;s hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia had reckoned on a rational Lucy until the Oxford term should be
      over. She might have anticipated a failure in the responsions, (who, in
      connexion with the Polysyllable, could mention being plucked for the
      little-go?) but it was more than she did expect that his rejection would
      send him home in sullen resentment resolved to punish Oxford by the
      withdrawal of his august name. He had been quizzed by the young,
      reprimanded by the old, plucked by the middle-aged, and he returned with
      his mouth, full of sentences against blind, benighted bigotry, and the
      futility of classical study, and of declamations, as an injured orphan,
      against his uncle&rsquo;s disregard of the intentions of his dear deceased
      parent, in keeping him from Bonn, Jena, Heidelberg, or any other of the
      outlandish universities whose guttural names he showered on the meek
      Vicar&rsquo;s desponding head.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was twenty-one, and could not be sent whither he would not go. His
      uncle&rsquo;s resource was Mr. Kendal, who strongly hoped that the link was
      about to snap, when, summoning the gentleman to the library, he gave him
      to understand that he should consider a refusal to resume his studies as
      tantamount to a dissolution of the engagement. A long speech ensued about
      dear mothers, amiable daughters, classics, languages, and foreign tours.
      That was all the account Mr. Kendal could give his wife of the dialogue,
      and she could only infer that Algernon&rsquo;s harangue had sent him into such a
      fit of abstraction, that he really could not tell the drift of it.
      However, he was clear that he had himself given no alternative between
      returning to Oxford and resigning Lucy.
    </p>
    <p>
      That same evening, Lucy, all blushes and tears, faltered out that she was
      very unwilling, she could not bear to leave them all, nor dear grandmamma,
      but dear Algernon had prevailed on her to say next August!
    </p>
    <p>
      When indignant astonishment permitted Albinia to speak, she reminded Lucy
      that a respectable career at Oxford had been the condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know,&rsquo; said Lucy, &lsquo;but dear Algernon convinced papa of the
      unreasonableness of such a stipulation under the circumstances.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia felt the ground cut away under her feet, and all she could attempt
      was a dry answer. &lsquo;We shall see what papa says; but you, Lucy, how can you
      think of marrying with your grandmamma in this state, and Gilbert in that
      camp of cholera&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I told Algernon it was not to be thought of,&rsquo; said Lucy, her tears
      flowing fast. But I don&rsquo;t know what to do, no one can tell how long it may
      go on, and we have no right to trifle with his feelings.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If he had any feelings for you, he would not ask it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, mamma, indeed!&rsquo; cried Lucy, earnestly; &lsquo;it was his feeling for me; he
      said I was looking quite languid and emaciated, and that he could not
      allow my&mdash;good looks and vivacity to be diminished by my attendance
      in a sick chamber. I told him never to mind, for it did not hurt me; but
      he said it was incumbent on him to take thought for me, and that he could
      not present me to his friends if I were not in full bloom of beauty; yes,
      indeed, he said so; and then he said it would be the right season for
      Italy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is impossible you can think of going so far away! Oh, Lucy! you should
      not have consented.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I could not help it,&rsquo; said Lucy, sobbing. &lsquo;I could not bear to contradict
      him, but please, mamma, let papa settle it for me. I don&rsquo;t want to go
      away; I told him I never would, I told him I had promised never to leave
      dear grandmamma; but you see he is so resolute, and he cannot bear to be
      without me. Oh! do get him to put it off&mdash;only if he is angry and
      goes to Italy without me, I know I shall die!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We will take care of you, my dear. I am sure we shall be able to show him
      how impossible a gay wedding would be at present; and I do not think he
      can press it,&rsquo; said Albinia, moved into soothing the present distress, and
      relieved to find that there was no heartlessness on Lucy&rsquo;s side.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a grand power is sheer obstinacy! It has all the momentum of a stone,
      or cannon-ball, or any other object set in motion without inconvenient
      sensations to obstruct its course!
    </p>
    <p>
      Algernon Dusautoy had decided on being married in August, and taking his
      obedient pupil-wife through a course of lectures on the continental
      galleries of art; and his determined singleness of aim prevailed against
      the united objections and opposition of four people, each of double or
      quadruple his wisdom and weight.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first great advantage was, that, as Albinia surmised, Mr. Kendal could
      not recal the finale of their interview, and having lost the thread of the
      rigmarole, did not know to what his silence had been supposed to assent.
      Next, Algernon conquered his uncle by representing Lucy as on the road to
      an atrophy, and persuading him that he should be much safer on the
      Continent with a wife than without one: and though the two ladies were
      harder to deal with in themselves, they were obliged to stand by the
      decision of their lords. Above all, he made way by his sincere habit of
      taking for granted whatever he wished, and by his magnanimous oblivion of
      remonstrance and denial; so that every day one party or the other found
      that assumed, as fixed in his favour, which had the day before been most
      strenuously refused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you consented to this, I thought I could not refuse that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I consent! I told him it was the last thing I could think of.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I own I was surprised, but he told me you had readily come into his
      views.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the usual tenor of consultations between the authorities, until
      their marvel at themselves and each other came to a height when they found
      themselves preparing for the wedding on the very day originally chosen by
      Algernon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kendal&rsquo;s letter to Gilbert was an absolute apology. Gilbert in Turkey
      was a very different person from Gilbert at Bayford, and had assumed in
      his father&rsquo;s mind the natural rights of son and heir; he seemed happy and
      valued, and the heat of the climate, pestiferous to so many, seemed but to
      give his Indian constitution the vigour it needed. When his comrades were
      laid up, or going away for better air, much duty was falling on him, and
      he was doing it with hearty good-will and effectiveness. Already the rapid
      changes had made him a lieutenant, and he wrote in the highest spirits.
      Moreover, he had fallen in with Bryan O&rsquo;More, and had been able to do him
      sundry kindnesses, the report of which brought Ulick to Willow Lawn in an
      overflow of gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a strange state of affairs there. Albinia was ashamed of the plea
      of &lsquo;could not help it,&rsquo; and yet that was the only one to rest on; the
      adherence to promises alone gave a sense of duty, and when or how the
      promises had been given was not clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides, no one could be certain even about poor Lucy&rsquo;s present
      satisfaction; she sometimes seemed like a little bird fluttering under the
      fascination of a snake. She was evidently half afraid of Algernon, and
      would breathe more freely when he was not at hand; but then a restlessness
      would come on if he did not appear as soon as she expected, as if she
      dreaded having offended him. She had violent bursts of remorseful tears,
      and great outpourings of fondness towards every one at home, and she
      positively did look ill enough to justify Algernon in saying that the
      present condition of matters was hurtful to her. Still she could not
      endure a word that remotely tended towards advising her to break off the
      engagement, or even to retard the wedding, and her admiration of her
      intended was unabated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, his affection could not be doubted; he liked her adoration of all
      his performances, and he regarded her with beneficent protection, as a
      piece of property; he made her magnificent presents, and conceded to her
      that the wedding tour should not be beyond Clifton, whence they would
      return to Willow Lawn, and judge ere deciding on going abroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said that it would be &lsquo;de bon ton&rsquo; to have the marriage strictly
      private. Even he saw the incongruity of festivity alongside of that
      chamber of decay and death; and besides, he had conceived such a distaste
      to the Drury family, that he had signified to Lucy that they must not make
      part of the spectacle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia and Sophy thought this so impertinent, that they manfully fought
      the battles of the Drurys, but without prevailing; Albinia took her
      revenge, by observing that this being the case, it was impossible to ask
      her brother and little Mary, whose well-sounding names she knew Algernon
      ambitionated for the benefit of the county paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Always doing what was most contrary to the theories with which she started
      in life, Albinia found herself taking the middle course that she
      contemned. She was marrying her first daughter with an aching, foreboding
      heart, unable either to approve or to prevent, and obliged to console and
      cheer just when she would have imagined herself insisting upon a rupture
      at all costs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy had said from the first that her sister could not go back. She
      expected her to be unhappy, and believed it the penalty of the wrongdoings
      in consenting to the clandestine correspondence; and treated her with
      melancholy kindness as a victim under sentence. She was very affectionate,
      but not at all consoling when Lucy was sad, and she was impatient and
      gloomy when the trousseau, or any of the privileges of a fiancee brought a
      renewal of gaiety and importance. A broken heart and ruined fortunes were
      the least of the consequences she augured, and she went about the house as
      if she had realized them both herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wedding-day came, and grandmamma was torpid and only half conscious,
      so that all could venture to leave her. The bride was not allowed to see
      her, lest the agitation should overwhelm both; for the poor girl was
      indeed looking like the victim her sister thought her, pale as death, with
      red rings round her extinguished eyes, and trembling from head to foot,
      the more at the apprehension that Algernon would think her a fright.
    </p>
    <p>
      After all that lavender and sal-volatile could do for her, she was such a
      spectacle, that when her father came to fetch her he was shocked, and
      said, tenderly, &lsquo;Lucy, my child, this must not be. Say one word, and all
      shall be over, and you shall never hear a word of reproach.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But Lucy only cast a frightened glance around, and rising up with the
      accents of perfect sincerity, said, &lsquo;No, papa; I am quite ready; I am
      quite happy. I was only silly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mind was evidently made up, and it was past Albinia&rsquo;s divination
      whether her agitation were composed of fear of the future and remorse for
      the past, or whether it were mere love of home and hurry of spirits,
      exaggerated by belief that a bride ought to weep. Probably it was a
      compound of all, and the whole of her reply perfect truth, especially the
      final clause.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they married her, poor child, very much as if they had been attending
      her to the block. Sophy&rsquo;s view of the case had infected them all beyond
      being dispelled by the stately complacency of the bridegroom, or the
      radiant joy and affection of his uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      They put her into a carriage, watched her away, and turned back to the
      task which she had left them, dreading the effects of her absence. She was
      missed, but less than they feared; the faculties had become too feeble for
      such strong emotion as had followed Gilbert&rsquo;s departure; and the void was
      chiefly perceptible by the plaintive and exacting clinging to Albinia, who
      had less and less time to herself and her children, and was somewhat
      uneasy as to the consequences as regarded Maurice. While Gilbert was at
      home, the child had been under some supervision; but now his independent
      and unruly spirit was left almost uncontrolled, except by his own
      intermittent young conscience, his father indulged him, and endured from
      him what would have been borne from no one else; and Sophy was his willing
      slave, unable to exact obedience, and never complaining, save under the
      most stringent necessity or sense of duty. He was too young for school,
      and there was nothing to be done but to go on, from day to day, in the
      trust that no harm could eventually ensue in consequence of so absolute a
      duty as the care of the sufferer; and that while the boy&rsquo;s truth and
      generosity were sound, though he might be a torment, his character might
      be all the stronger afterwards for that very indocility.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not satisfactory, and many mothers would have been miserable; but
      it was not in Albinia&rsquo;s nature to be miserable when her hands were full,
      and she was doing her best. She had heard her brother say that when good
      people gave their children sound principles and spoilt them, they gave the
      children the trouble of self-conquest instead of doing it for them. She
      had great faith in Maurice&rsquo;s undertaking this task in due time; and while
      she felt that she still had her hand on the rein she must be content to
      leave it loose for a while.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides, when his father and sisters, and, least of all, herself, did not
      find him a plague, did it much matter if other people did?

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Exulting peals rang out from the Bayford tower, and as Mr. and Mrs.
      Cavendish Dusautoy alighted from their carriage at Willow Lawn, the cry of
      the vicar and of the assembled household was, &lsquo;Have you heard that
      Sebastopol is taken?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Any news of Gilbert?&rsquo; was Lucy&rsquo;s demand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, the cavalry were not landed, so he had nothing to do with it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I say, uncle,&rsquo; said Algernon, &lsquo;shall I send up a sovereign to those
      ringers?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Eh! poor fellows, they will be very glad of it, thank you; only I must
      take care they don&rsquo;t drink it up. I&rsquo;m sure they must be tired enough;
      they&rsquo;ve been at it ever since the telegraph came in!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There!&rsquo; exclaimed Algernon; &lsquo;Barton must have telegraphed from the
      station when we set out!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You? Did you think the bells were ringing for <i>you</i>,&rsquo; exclaimed his
      uncle, &lsquo;when there&rsquo;s a great battle won, and Sebastopol taken?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Telegraphs are always lies!&rsquo; quoth Mr. Cavendish Dusautoy, tersely, &lsquo;I
      don&rsquo;t believe anything has happened at all!&rsquo; and he re-pocketed the
      sovereign.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime Lucy was in a rapture of embracing. She was spread out with stiff
      silk flounces and velvet mantle, so as to emulate her husband&rsquo;s
      importance, and her chains and bracelets clattered so much, that Mr.
      Kendal could not help saying, &lsquo;You should have taken lessons of your Ayah,
      to learn how to manage your bangles.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! papa,&rsquo; said she, with a newly-learnt little laugh, &lsquo;I could not help
      it; Louise could not find room for them in my dressing-case.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They were not, however, lost upon the whole of the family. Grandmamma&rsquo;s
      dim eyes lighted when she recognised her favourite grand-daughter in such
      gorgeous array, and that any one should have come back again was so new
      and delightful, that it constantly recurred as a fresh surprise and
      pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      All were glad to have her again&mdash;their own Lucy, as she still was,
      though somewhat of the grandiose style and self-consequence of her husband
      had overlaid the original nature. She was as good-natured and obliging as
      ever, and though beginning by conferring her favours as condescensions,
      she soon would forget that she was the great Mrs. Cavendish Dusautoy, and
      quickly become the eager, helpful Lucy. She was in very good looks, and
      bright and happy, admiring Algernon, rejoicing to obey his behests, and
      enhancing his dignity and her own by her discourses upon his talents and
      importance. How far she was at ease with him, Albinia sometimes doubted;
      there now and then was an air of greater freedom when he left the room,
      and some of her favourite old household avocations were tenderly resumed
      by stealth, as though she feared he might think them unworthy of his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave her spare time to the invalid, who was revived by her presence as
      by a sunbeam; and Albinia, in her relief and gratitude, did her utmost to
      keep Algernon happy and contented. She resigned a room to him as an
      atelier, and let the little Awk be captured to have her likeness taken,
      she promoted the guitar and key-bugle, and abstained from resenting his
      strictures on her dinners.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such a guest reduced Mr. Kendal to absolute silence, but she did not think
      he suffered much therefrom, and he was often relieved, for all the
      neighbourhood asked the young couple to dinner. Mrs. Cavendish Dusautoy&rsquo;s
      toilette was as good as a play to the oldest and youngest inhabitants of
      the house, her little sister used to stand by the dressing-table with her
      small fingers straightened to sustain a column of rings threaded on them,
      and her arm weighed down with bracelets, and grandmamma&rsquo;s happiest moments
      were when she was raised up to contemplate the costly robes, jewelled
      neck, and garlanded head of her darling.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it turned out that Sebastopol was anything but taken, Mr. Cavendish
      Dusautoy&rsquo;s incredulity was a precious confirmation of his esteem for his
      own sagacity, more especially as Ulick O&rsquo;More and Maurice had worn out the
      little brass piece of ordnance in firing feux de joie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But,&rsquo; said Maurice, &lsquo;papa always said it was not true. Now you only said
      so when you found the bells were ringing for that, and not for you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Maurice&rsquo;s observations were not always convenient. Algernon, with much
      pomp, had caused a horse to be led to the door, for which he had lately
      paid eighty guineas, and he was expatiating on its merits, when Maurice
      broke out, &lsquo;That&rsquo;s Macheath, the horse that Archie Tritton bought of Mr.
      Nugent&rsquo;s coachman for twenty pounds.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush, Maurice!&rsquo; said his father, &lsquo;you know nothing of it; and Mr.
      Cavendish Dusautoy pursued, &lsquo;It was bred at Lord Lewthorp&rsquo;s, and sold
      because it was too tall for its companion. Laing was on the point of
      sending it to Tattersalls, where he was secure of a hundred, but he was
      willing to oblige me, as we had had transactions before.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Papa!&rsquo; cried Maurice, &lsquo;I know it is Macheath, for Mr. Tritton showed him
      to Gilbert and me, when he had just got him, and said he was a showy
      beast, but incurably lame, so he should get what he could for him from
      Laing. Now, James, isn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo; he called to the servant who was sedulously
      turning away a grinning face, but just muttered, &lsquo;Same, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kendal charitably looked the other way, and Algernon muttered some
      species of imprecation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thenceforth Maurice took every occasion of inquiring what had become of
      Macheath, whether Laing had refunded the price, and what had been done to
      him for telling stories.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the boy began in innocence, he went on in mischief; he was just old
      enough to be a most aggravating compound of simplicity and malice. He was
      fully aware that Mr. Cavendish Dusautoy was held cheap by his own
      favourites, and had been partly the cause of his dear Gilbert&rsquo;s troubles,
      and his sharp wits and daring nature were excited to the utmost by the
      solemn irritation that he produced. Not only was it irresistibly droll to
      tease one so destitute of fun, but he had the strongest desire to see how
      angry it was possible to make the big brother-in-law, of whom every one
      seemed in awe.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, he had recourse to the old term Polysyllable, and when Lucy
      remonstrated, he answered, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve a right to call my brother what I
      please.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You know how angry mamma would be to hear you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mamma calls him the Polysyllable herself,&rsquo; said Maurice, looking full at
      his victim.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy, who would have given the world to hinder this epithet from coming to
      her husband&rsquo;s knowledge, began explaining something about Gilbert&rsquo;s
      nonsense before he knew him, and how it had been long disused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s not true, Lucy,&rsquo; quoth the tormentor. &lsquo;I heard mamma tell Sophy
      herself this morning to write for some fish-sauce, because she said that
      Polysyllable was so fanciful about his dinner.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy was ready to cry, and Algernon, endeavouring to recal his usual
      dignity, exclaimed, &lsquo;If Mrs. Kendal&mdash;I mean, Mrs. Kendal has it in
      her power to take liberties, but if I find you repeating such again, you
      little imp, it shall be at your risk.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What will you do to me?&rsquo; asked the sturdy varlet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear Maurice, I hope you&rsquo;ll never know! Pray don&rsquo;t try!&rsquo; cried Lucy; but
      if she had had any knowledge of character, she would have seen that she
      had only provoked the little Berserkar&rsquo;s curiosity, and had made him
      determined on proving the undefined threat. So the unfortunate Algernon
      seldom descended the stairs without two childish faces being protruded
      from the balusters of the nursery-flight over-head, pursuing him with
      hissing whispers of &lsquo;Polysyllable&rsquo; and &lsquo;Polly-silly,&rsquo; and if he ventured
      on indignant gestures, Maurice returned them with nutcracker grimaces and
      provoking assurances to his little sister that he could not hurt her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Algernon could not complain without making himself ridiculous, and Albinia
      was too much engaged to keep watch over her son, so that the persecution
      daily became more intolerable, and barren indications of wrath were so
      diverting to the little monkey, that the presence of the heads of the
      family was the sole security from his tricks. Poor Lucy was the chief
      sufferer, unable to restrain her brother, and enduring the brunt of her
      husband&rsquo;s irritation, with the great disappointment of being unable to
      make him happy at her home, and fearing every day that he would fulfil his
      threat of not staying another week in the house with that intolerable
      child, for the sake of any one&rsquo;s grandmother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tidings came, however, that completely sobered Maurice, and made them
      unable to think of moving. It was the first rumour of the charge of
      Balaklava, with the report that the 25th Lancers were cut to pieces. In
      spite of Algernon&rsquo;s reiteration that telegraphs were lies, all the
      household would have been glad to lose the sense of existence during the
      time of suspense. Albinia&rsquo;s heart was wrung as she thought of the cold
      hurried manner of the last farewell, and every look she cast at her
      husband&rsquo;s calm melancholy face, seemed to be asking pardon that his son
      was not safe in India.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late that evening the maid came hurriedly in with a packet of papers. &lsquo;A
      telegraph, ma&rsquo;am, come express from Hadminster.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was to Mrs Kendal from one of her friends at the Horse Guards. She did
      not know how she found courage to turn her eyes on it, but her shriek was
      not of sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Major the Honourable F. Ferrars, severely wounded&mdash;right arm
      amputated.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lieutenant Gilbert Kendal, slightly wounded&mdash;contusion, rib broken.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw the light of thankfulness break upon Mr. Kendal&rsquo;s face, and the
      next moment flew up to her boy&rsquo;s bed-side. He started up, half asleep, but
      crying out, Mamma, where&rsquo;s Gibbie?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Safe, safe! Maurice dearest, safe; only slightly wounded! Oh, Maurice,
      God has been very good to us!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He flung his arms round her neck, as she knelt beside his crib in the
      dark, and thus Mr. Kendal found the mother and son. As he bent to kiss
      them, Maurice exclaimed, with a sort of anger, &lsquo;Oh, mamma, why have I got
      a bullet in my throat?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia laughed a little hysterically, as if she had the like bullet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was very kind of Lord H&mdash;&mdash;,&rsquo; fervently exclaimed Mr.
      Kendal; &lsquo;you must write to thank him, Albinia. Gilbert may be considered
      safe while he is laid up. Perhaps he may be sent home. What should you say
      to that, Maurice?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! I wouldn&rsquo;t come home to lose the fun,&rsquo; said Maurice. &lsquo;Oh, mamma, let
      me get up to tell Awkey, and run up to Ulick! Gilbert will be the colonel
      when I&rsquo;m a cornet! Oh! I must get up!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His outspoken childish joy seemed to relieve Albinia&rsquo;s swelling heart, too
      full for the expression of thankfulness, and the excitement was too much
      even for the boy, for he burst into passionate sobs when forbidden to get
      up and waken his little sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sobering came in Mr. Kendal&rsquo;s mention of Fred. Albinia was obliged to
      ask what had happened to him, and was shocked at having overlooked so
      terrible a misfortune; but Maurice seemed to be quite satisfied. &lsquo;You
      know, mamma, it said they were cut to pieces. Can&rsquo;t they make him a wooden
      arm?&rsquo; evidently thinking he could be repaired as easily as the creatures
      in his sister&rsquo;s Noah&rsquo;s Ark. Even Algernon showed a heartiness and
      fellow-feeling that seemed to make him more like one of the family.
      Moreover, he was so much elevated at the receipt of a telegraph direct
      from the fountain-head, that he rode about the next day over all the
      neighbourhood with the tidings and comported himself as though he had
      private access to all Lord Raglan&rsquo;s secrets.
    </p>
    <p>
      The unwonted emotion tamed Maurice for several days, and his behaviour was
      the better for his daily rides with papa to Hadminster, to forestall the
      second post. At last, on his return, his voice rang through the house.
      &lsquo;Mamma, where are you? The letter is come, and Gilbert shot two Russians,
      and saved Cousin Fred!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I opened your letter, Albinia,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal; and, as she took it from
      him, he said, &lsquo;Thank God, I never dared hope for such a day as this!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He shut himself into the library, while Albinia was sharing with Sophy the
      precious letter, but with a moment&rsquo;s disappointment at finding it not from
      Gilbert, but from her brother William.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Before you receive this,&rsquo; he wrote, &lsquo;you will have heard of the affair of
      to-day, and that our two lads have come out of it better than some others.
      There are but nine officers living, and only four unhurt out of the 25th
      Lancers, and Fred&rsquo;s escape is entirely owing to your son.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then followed a brief narrative of the events of Balaklava, that fatal
      charge so well described as &lsquo;magnifique mais pas la guerre,&rsquo; a history
      that seemed like a dream in connexion with the timid Gilbert. His
      individual story was thus:&mdash;He safely rode the &lsquo;half a league&rsquo; 
      forward, but when more than half way back, his horse was struck to the
      ground by a splinter of the same shell that overthrew Major Ferrars, at a
      few paces&rsquo; distance from him. Quickly disengaging himself from his horse,
      Gilbert ran to assist his friend, and succeeded in extricating him from
      his horse, and supporting him through the remainder of the terrible space
      commanded by the batteries. Fred, unable to move without aid, and to whom
      each step was agony, had entreated Gilbert to relinquish his hold, and not
      peril himself for a life already past rescue; but Gilbert had not seemed
      to hear, and when several of the enemy came riding down on them, he had
      used his revolver with such effect, as to lay two of the number prostrate,
      and deter the rest from repeating the attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All this I heard from Fred,&rsquo; continued the General; &lsquo;he is in his usual
      spirits, and tells me that he feels quite jolly since his arm has been
      off, and he has been in his own bed, but I fear he has a good deal to
      suffer, for his right side is terribly lacerated, and I shall be glad when
      the next few days are over. He desires me to say with his love that the
      best turn you ever did him was putting young Kendal into the 25th. Tell
      your husband that I congratulate him on his son&rsquo;s conduct, and am afraid
      that his promotion without purchase is only too certain. Gilbert&rsquo;s only
      message was his love. Speaking seems to give him pain, and he is
      altogether more prostrated than so slight a wound accounts for; but when I
      saw him, he had just been told of the death of his colonel and several of
      his brother officers, among them young Wynne, who shared his tent; and he
      was completely overcome. There is, however, no cause for uneasiness; he
      had not even been aware that he was hurt, until he fainted while Fred was
      under the surgeon&rsquo;s hands, and was then found to have an ugly contusion of
      the chest, and a fracture of the uppermost rib on the left side. A few
      days&rsquo; rest will set all that to rights, and I expect to see him on
      horseback before we can ship poor Fred for Scutari. In the meantime they
      are both in Fred&rsquo;s tent, which is fairly comfortable.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia understood whence came Gilbert&rsquo;s heroism. He had charged at first,
      as he had hunted with Maurice, because there was no doing otherwise, and
      in the critical moment the warm heart had done the rest, and equalled
      constitutional courage: but then, she saw the gentle tender spirit sinking
      under the slight injury, and far more at the suffering of his friend, the
      deadly havoc among his comrades, and his own share in the carnage. The
      General coolly mentioned the two enemies who had fallen by his pistol, and
      Maurice shouted about them as if they had been two rabbits, but she knew
      enough of Gilbert to be sure that what he might do in the exigency of
      self-defence, would shock and sicken him in recollection. Poor Fred! how
      little would she once have believed that his frightful wound could be a
      secondary matter with her, only enhancing her gratitude on account of
      another.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was a happy evening; Maurice was sent to ask Ulick to dinner, and at
      dessert drank the healths of his soldier relatives, among whom Mr. Kendal
      with a smile at Ulick, included Bryan O&rsquo;More.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the universal good-will of her triumph, Albinia having read her
      precious letter to every one, resolved to let the Drurys hear it, before
      forwarding it to Fairmead. Lucy&rsquo;s neglect of that family was becoming
      flagrant, and Albinia was resolved to take her to make the call.
      Therefore, after promulgating her intentions too decidedly for Algernon to
      oppose them, she set out with Lucy in the most virtuous state of mind.
      Maurice was to ride out with his father, and Sophy was taking care of
      grandmamma, so she made her expedition with an easy mind, and absolutely
      enjoyed the change of scenery.
    </p>
    <p>
      The war had drawn every one nearer together, and Mrs. Drury was really
      anxious about Gilbert, and grateful for the intelligence. Nor did Lucy
      meet with anything unpleasant. Mrs. Cavendish Dusautoy, in waist-deep
      flounces, a Paris bonnet, and her husband&rsquo;s dignity, impressed her
      cousins, and whatever use they might make of their tongues, it was not
      till after she was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the carriage stopped at the door, Sophy came out with such a perturbed
      an expression, as seemed to prelude fatal tidings; and Lucy was pausing to
      listen, when she was hastily summoned by her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! mamma, he has struck Maurice such a blow!&rsquo; cried Sophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Algernon? where&rsquo;s Maurice? is he hurt?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is in the library with papa.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She was there in a moment. Maurice sat on his father&rsquo;s knee, listening to
      Pope&rsquo;s Homer, leaning against him, with eye, cheek, and nose exceedingly
      swelled and reddened; but these were symptoms of which she had seen enough
      in past days not to be greatly terrified, even while she exclaimed aghast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aye!&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal, sternly. &lsquo;What do you think of young Dusautoy&rsquo;s
      handiwork?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What could you have done to him, Maurice?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I painted his image.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The children got into the painting-room,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal, &lsquo;and did some
      mischief; Maurice ought to have known better, but that was no excuse for
      his violence. I do not know what would have been the consequence, if poor
      little Albinia&rsquo;s screams had not alarmed me. I found Algernon striking him
      with his doubled fist.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I gave him a dig in the nose,&rsquo; cried Maurice, in exultation; &lsquo;I
      pulled ever so much hair out of his whiskers. I had it just now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This sounds very sad,&rsquo; said Albinia, interrupting the search for the
      trophy. &lsquo;What were you doing in the painting-room? You know you had no
      business there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, mamma, little Awk wanted me to look at the pictures that Lucy shows
      her. And then, don&rsquo;t you know his image? the little white bare boy pulling
      the thorn out of his foot. Awkey said he was naughty not to have his
      clothes on, and so I thought it would be such fun to make a militiaman of
      him, and so the paints were all about, and so I gave him a red coat and
      black trousers.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, Maurice, Maurice, how could you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I couldn&rsquo;t help it, mamma! I did so want to see what Algernon would do!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So he came up and caught us. And wasn&rsquo;t he in a jolly good rage? that&rsquo;s
      all. He stamped, and called me names, and got hold of me to shake me, but
      I know I kicked him well, and I had quite a handful out of his whisker;
      but you see poor little Awkey is only a girl, and couldn&rsquo;t help squalling,
      so papa came up.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And in time!&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal; &lsquo;he reeled against me, almost stunned, and
      was hardly himself for some moments. His nose bled violently. That
      fellow&rsquo;s fist might knock down an ox.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But he didn&rsquo;t knock <i>me</i> down,&rsquo; said Maurice. &lsquo;You told me he did
      not, papa.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s all he thinks of!&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal, in admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a cry nor a tear from first to last. I told Sophy to let me know when
      Bowles came.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For a black eye?&rsquo; cried the hard-hearted mother, laughing. &lsquo;You should
      have seen what Maurice and Fred used to do to each other.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, tell me, mamma,&rsquo; cried Maurice, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not now, master,&rsquo; she said, not thinking his pugnacity in need of such
      respectable examples. &lsquo;It would be more to the purpose to ask Mr.
      Cavendish Dusautoy&rsquo;s pardon for such very bad behaviour.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kendal looked at her in indignant surprise. &lsquo;Ours is not the side for
      the apology,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;If Dusautoy has a spark of proper feeling, he must
      excuse himself for such a brutal assault.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am afraid Maurice provoked it; I hope my little boy is sorry for having
      been so mischievous, and sees that he deserves&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kendal silenced her by an impatient gesture, and feeling that anything
      was better than the discussion before the boy, she tried to speak
      indifferently, and not succeeding, left the room, much annoyed that alarm
      and indignation had led the indulgent father to pet and coax the spirit
      that only wanted to be taken down, and as if her discipline had received
      its first real shock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kendal followed her upstairs, no less vexed. &lsquo;Albinia, this is
      absurd,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;I will not have the child punished, or made to ask
      pardon for being shamefully struck.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was shameful enough,&rsquo; said Albinia; &lsquo;but, after all, I can&rsquo;t wonder
      that Algernon was in a passion; Maurice did behave very ill, and it would
      be much better for him if you would not make him more impudent than he is
      already.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I did not expect you to take part against your own child, when he has
      been so severely maltreated,&rsquo; said he, with such unreasonable displeasure,
      that almost thinking it play, she laughed and said, &lsquo;You are as bad as the
      mothers of the school-children, when they wont have them beaten.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave a look as if loth to trust his ears, walked into his room, and
      shut the door. The thrill of horror came over her that this was the first
      quarrel. She had been saucy when he was serious, and had offended him. She
      sprang to the door, knocked and called, and was in agony at the moment&rsquo;s
      delay ere he returned, with his face still stern and set. Pleading and
      earnest she raised her eyes, and surrendered unconditionally. &lsquo;Dear
      Edmund, don&rsquo;t be vexed with me, I should not have said it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never mind,&rsquo; he said, affectionately; &lsquo;I do not wish to interfere with
      your authority, but it would be impossible to punish a child who has
      suffered so severely; and I neither choose that Dusautoy should be made to
      think himself the injured party, nor that Maurice should be put to the
      pain of apologizing for an offence, which the other party has taken on
      himself to cancel with interest.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia was too much demolished to recollect her two arguments, that pride
      on their side would only serve to make Algernon prouder, and that she did
      not believe that asking pardon would be so bitter a pill to Maurice as his
      father supposed. She could only feel thankful to have been forgiven for
      her own offence.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they met at dinner, all were formal, Algernon stiff and haughty,
      ashamed, but too grand to betray himself, and Lucy restless and uneasy,
      her eyes looking as if she had been crying. When Maurice came in at
      dessert, the fourth part of his countenance emulating the unlucky cast in
      gorgeous hues of crimson and violet, Algernon was startled, and turning to
      Albinia, muttered something about &lsquo;never having intended,&rsquo; and &lsquo;having had
      no idea.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He might have said more, if Mr. Kendal, with Maurice on his knee, had not
      looked as if he expected it; and that look sealed Albinia&rsquo;s lips against
      expressing regret for the provocation; but Maurice exclaimed, &lsquo;Never mind,
      Algernon, it was all fair, and it doesn&rsquo;t hurt now. I wouldn&rsquo;t have
      touched your image, but that I wanted to know what you would do to me.
      Shake hands; people always do when they&rsquo;ve had a good mill.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kendal looked across the table to his wife in a state of unbounded
      exultation in his generous boy, and Albinia felt infinitely relieved and
      grateful. Mr. Cavendish Dusautoy took the firm young paw, and said with an
      attempt at condescension, &lsquo;Very well, Maurice, the subject shall be
      mentioned no more, since you have received a severer lesson than I
      intended, and appear sensible of your error.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It wasn&rsquo;t you that made me so,&rsquo; began Maurice, with defiant eye; but with
      a strong sense of &lsquo;let well alone,&rsquo; his father cut him short with, &lsquo;That&rsquo;s
      enough, my man, you&rsquo;ve said all that can be wished,&rsquo; lifted him again on
      his knee, and stopped his mouth with almonds and raisins.
    </p>
    <p>
      The subject was mentioned no more; Lucy considered peace as proclaimed,
      and herself relieved from the necessity of such an unprecedented deed as
      preferring an accusation against Maurice, and Albinia, unaware of the
      previous persecution, did not trace that Maurice considered himself as
      challenged to prove, that experience of his brother-in-law&rsquo;s fist did not
      suffice to make him cease from his &lsquo;fun.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days after, Algernon was coming in from riding, when a simple voice
      upon the stairs observed, &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s such a pretty picture!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Eh! what?&rsquo; said Algernon; and Maurice held it near to him as he stood
      taking off his great coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Such a pretty picture, but you mustn&rsquo;t have it! No, it is Ulick&rsquo;s.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Heavens and earth!&rsquo; thundered Algernon, as he gathered up the meaning.
      &lsquo;Who has dared&mdash;? Give it me&mdash;or&mdash;&rsquo; and as soon as he was
      freed from the sleeves, he snatched at the paper, but the boy had already
      sprung up to the first landing, and waving his treasure, shouted, &lsquo;No,
      it&rsquo;s not for you, I&rsquo;ll not give you Ulick&rsquo;s picture.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ulick!&rsquo; cried Algernon, in redoubled fury. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re put up to this! Give
      it me this instant, or it shall be the worse for you;&rsquo; but ere he could
      stride up the first flight, Maurice&rsquo;s last leg was disappearing round the
      corner above, and the next moment the exhibition was repeated overhead in
      the gallery. Thither did Algernon rush headlong, following the scampering
      pattering feet, till the door of Maurice&rsquo;s little room was slammed in his
      face. Bursting it open, he found the chamber empty, but there was a shout
      of elvish laughter outside, and a cry of dismay coming up from the garden,
      impelled him to mount the rickety deal-table below the deep sunk dormer
      window, when thrusting out his head and shoulders, he beheld his wife and
      her parents gazing up in terror from the lawn. No wonder, for there was a
      narrow ledge of leading without, upon which Maurice had suddenly appeared,
      running with unwavering steps till in a moment he stooped down, and popped
      through the similar window of Gilbert&rsquo;s room.
    </p>
    <p>
      While still too dizzy with horror to feel secure that the child was indeed
      safe within, those below were startled by a frantic shout from Algernon:
      &lsquo;Let me out! I say, the imp has locked me in! Let me out!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia flew into the house and upstairs. Maurice was flourishing the key,
      and executing a war-dance before the captive&rsquo;s door, with a chant
      alternating of war-whoops, &lsquo;Promise not to hurt it, and I&rsquo;ll let you out!&rsquo; 
      and &lsquo;Pity poor prisoners in a foreign land!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She called to him to desist, but he was too wild to be checked by her
      voice, and as she advanced to capture him, he shot like an arrow to the
      other end of the passage, and down the back-stairs. She promised speedy
      rescue, and hurried down, hoping to seize the culprit in the hall, but he
      had whipped out at the back-door, and was making for the garden gate, when
      his father hastened down the path to meet him, and seeing his retreat cut
      off, he plunged into the bushes, and sprang like a cat up a
      cockspur-thorn, too slender for ascent by a heavier weight, and thence
      grinned and waved his hand to his prisoner at the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Maurice,&rsquo; called his father, &lsquo;what does this mean?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I only want to take home Ulick&rsquo;s picture. Then I&rsquo;ll let him out.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What picture?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s my secret.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is not play, Maurice,&rsquo; said Albinia. &lsquo;Attend to papa.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy swung the light shrub about with him in a manner fearful to
      behold, and looked irresolute. Lucy put in her cry, &lsquo;You very naughty
      child, give up the key this moment,&rsquo; and above, Algernon bawled appeals to
      Mr. Kendal, and threats to Maurice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Silence!&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal, sternly. &lsquo;Maurice, this must not be. Come
      down, and give me the key of your room.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will, papa,&rsquo; said Maurice, in a reasonable voice. &lsquo;Only please promise
      not to let Algernon have Ulick&rsquo;s picture, for I got it without his knowing
      it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I promise,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal. &lsquo;Let us put an end to this.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Maurice came down, and brought the key to his father, and while Lucy
      hastened to release her husband, Mr. Kendal seized the boy, finding him
      already about again to take flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Papa, let me take home Ulick&rsquo;s picture before he gets out,&rsquo; said Maurice,
      finding the grasp too strong for him; but Mr. Kendal had taken the picture
      out of his hand, and looked at it with changed countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      It depicted the famous drawing-room scene, in its native element, the moon
      squinting through inky clouds at Lucy swooning on the sofa, while the
      lofty presence of the Polysyllable discharged the fluid from the inkstand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did Mr. O&rsquo;More give you this?&rsquo; asked Mr. Kendal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, it tumbled out of his paper-case. You know he said I might go to his
      rooms and get the Illustrated News with the picture of Balaklava, and so
      the newspaper knocked the paper-case down, and all the things tumbled out,
      so I picked this up, and thought I would see what Algernon would say to
      it, and then put it back again. Let me have it, papa, if he catches me,
      he&rsquo;ll tear it to smithereens.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t talk Irish, sir,&rsquo; said his father. &lsquo;I see where your impertinence
      comes from, and I will put a stop to it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Maurice gave back a step, amazed at his father&rsquo;s unwonted anger, but far
      greater wrath was descending in the person of Mr. Cavendish Dusautoy, who
      came striding across the lawn, and planting himself before his
      father-in-law, demanded, &lsquo;I beg to know, sir, if it is your desire that I
      should be deliberately insulted in this house?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No one can be more concerned than I am at what has occurred.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well, sir; then I require that this intolerable child be soundly
      flogged, that beggarly Irishman kicked out, and that infamous libel
      destroyed!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, papa,&rsquo; cried Maurice, &lsquo;you promised me the picture should be safe!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I promise you, you impudent brat,&rsquo; cried Algernon, &lsquo;that you shall learn
      what it is to insult your elders! You shall be flogged till you repent
      it!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will allow me to judge of the discipline of my own family,&rsquo; said Mr.
      Kendal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ay! I knew how it would be! You encourage that child in every sort of
      unbearable impudence; but I have endured it long enough, and I give you
      warning that I do not remain another night under this roof unless I see
      the impertinence flogged out of him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Papa never whips me,&rsquo; interposed Maurice. &lsquo;You must ask mamma.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kendal bit his lips, and Albinia could have smiled, but their sense of
      the ludicrous inflamed Algernon, and like one beside himself, he swung
      round, and declaring he should ask his uncle if that were proper
      treatment, he marched across the lawn, while Mr. Kendal exclaimed, &lsquo;More
      childish than Maurice!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, mamma, what shall I do?&rsquo; was Lucy&rsquo;s woful cry, as she turned back,
      finding herself unable to keep up with his huge step, and her calls
      disregarded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear,&rsquo; said Albinia, affectionately, &lsquo;you had better compose yourself
      and follow him. His uncle will bring him to reason, and then you can tell
      him how sorry we are.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You may assure him,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal, &lsquo;that I am as much hurt as he can
      be, that such an improper use should have been made of O&rsquo;More&rsquo;s intimacy
      here, and I mean to mark my sense of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And,&rsquo; said Lucy, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think anything would pacify him so much as
      Maurice being only a little beaten, not to hurt him, you know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If Maurice be punished, it shall not be in revenge,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid nothing else will do,&rsquo; said Lucy, wringing her hands. &lsquo;He has
      really declared that he will not sleep another night here unless Maurice
      is punished; and whatever he says, he&rsquo;ll do, and I know it would kill me
      to go away in this manner.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her father confidently averred that he would do no such thing, but she
      cried so much as to move Maurice into exclaiming, &lsquo;Look here, Lucy, I&rsquo;ll
      come up with you, and let him give me one good punch, and then we shall
      all be comfortable again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know about the punching,&rsquo; said Albinia; &lsquo;but I think the least
      you can do, Maurice, is to go and ask his forgiveness for having been so
      very naughty. You were not thinking what you were about when you locked
      him in.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This measure was adopted, Mr. Kendal accompanying Lucy and the boy, while
      Albinia went in search of Sophy, whom she found in grandmamma&rsquo;s room,
      looking very pale. &lsquo;Well?&rsquo; was the inquiry, and she told what had passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope Maurice will be punished,&rsquo; said Sophy; so unwonted a sentiment,
      that Albinia quite started, though it was decidedly her own opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That meddling with papers was very bad,&rsquo; she said, with an extenuating
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fun is a perfect demon when it becomes master,&rsquo; said Sophy. It was plain
      that it was not Maurice that she was thinking of, but the caricature. Her
      sister should have been sacred from derision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We must remember,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;that it was only through Maurice&rsquo;s meddling
      that we became aware of the existence of this precious work. It is not as
      if he had shown it to any one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How many of the O&rsquo;Mores have made game of it?&rsquo; asked Sophy, bitterly.
      &lsquo;No, I am glad I know of it, I shall not be deceived any more.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With these words she withdrew, evidently resolved to put an end to the
      subject. Her face was like iron, and Albinia grieved for the deep
      resentment that the man whom she had ventured to think of as devoted to
      herself, had made game of her sister. Poor Sophy, to her that tryste had
      been a subject of unmitigated affliction and shame, and it was a cruel
      wound that Ulick O&rsquo;More should, of all men, have turned it into ridicule.
      What would be the effect on her?
    </p>
    <p>
      In process of time Mr. Kendal returned. &lsquo;Albinia,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;this is a
      most unfortunate affair. He is perfectly impracticable, insists on
      starting for Paris to-morrow, and I verily believe he will.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor Lucy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She is in such distress, that I could not bear to look at her, but he
      will not attend to her, nor to his uncle and aunt. Mrs. Dusautoy proposed
      that they should come to the vicarage, where there would be no danger of
      collisions with Maurice; but his mind can admit no idea but that he has
      been insulted, and that we encourage it, and he thinks his dignity
      concerned in resenting it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not much dignity in being driven off the field by a child of six years
      old.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So his aunt told him, but he mixes it up with O&rsquo;More, and insists on my
      complaining to Mr. Goldsmith, and getting the lad dismissed for a
      libellous caricaturist, as he calls it. Now, little as I should have
      expected such conduct from O&rsquo;More, it could not be made a ground of
      complaint to his uncle.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should think not. No one with more wit than Algernon would have dreamt
      of it! But if Ulick came and apologized? Ah! but I forgot! Mr. Goldsmith
      sent him to London this morning. Well, it may be better that he should be
      out of the way of Algernon in his present mood.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Humph!&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal. &lsquo;It is the first time I ever allowed a stranger
      to be intimate in my family, and it shall be the last. I never imagined
      him aware of the circumstance.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nor I; I am sure none of us mentioned it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Maurice told him, I suppose. It is well that we should be aware who has
      instigated the child&rsquo;s impertinence. I shall keep him as much as possible
      with me; he must be cured of Irish brogue and Irish coolness before they
      are confirmed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kendal&rsquo;s conscience was evidently relieved by transferring to the
      Irishman the imputation of fostering Maurice&rsquo;s malpractices.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were interrupted by Lucy&rsquo;s arrival. She was come to take leave of
      home, for her lord was not to be dissuaded from going to London by the
      evening&rsquo;s train. The greater the consternation, the sweeter his revenge.
      Never able to see more than one side of a question, he could not perceive
      how impossible it was for the Kendals to fulfil his condition with regard
      to Ulick O&rsquo;More, and he sullenly adhered to his obstinate determination.
      Lucy was in an agony of grief, and perhaps the most painful blow was the
      perception how little he was swayed by consideration for her. Her maid
      packed, while her parents tried to console her. It was easier when she
      bewailed the terrors of the voyage, and the uncertainty of hearing of dear
      grandmamma and dear Gilbert, than when she sobbed about Algernon having no
      feeling for her. It might be only too true, but her wifely submission
      ought not to have acknowledged it, and they would not hear when they could
      not comfort; and so they were forced to launch her on the world, with a
      tyrant instead of a guide, and dreading the effect of dissipation on her
      levity of mind, as much as they grieved for her feeble spirit. It was a
      piteous parting&mdash;a mournful departure for a bride&mdash;a heavy
      penalty for vanity and weakness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately the result is to an action as the lens through which it is
      viewed, and the turpitude of the deed seems to increase or diminish
      according to the effect it produces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had it been in Algernon Dusautoy&rsquo;s nature to receive the joke
      good-humouredly, it might have been regarded as an audacious exercise of
      wit, and have been quickly forgotten, but when it had actually made a
      breach between him and his wife&rsquo;s family, and driven him from Bayford when
      everything conspired to make his departure unfeelingly cruel, the
      caricature was regarded as a serious insult and an abuse of intimacy. Even
      Mr. Kendal was not superior to this view, feeling the offence with all the
      sensitiveness of a hot-tempered man, a proud reserved guardian of the
      sanctities of home, and of a father who had seen his daughter&rsquo;s weakest
      and most faulty action turned into ridicule, and he seemed to feel himself
      bound to atone for not going to all the lengths to which Algernon would
      have impelled him, by showing the utmost displeasure within the bounds of
      common sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia, better appreciating the irresistibly ludicrous aspect of the
      adventure, argued that the sketch harmlessly shut up in a paper-case
      showed no great amount of insolence, and that considering how the
      discovery had been made, it ought not to be visited. She thought the
      drawing had better be restored without remarks by the same hand that had
      abstracted it; but Mr. Kendal sternly declared this was impossible, and
      Sophy&rsquo;s countenance seconded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, then,&rsquo; said Albinia, &lsquo;put it into my hands. I&rsquo;m a bad manager in
      general, but I can promise that Ulick will come down so shocked and
      concerned, that you will not have the heart not to forgive him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The question is not of forgiveness,&rsquo; said Sophy, in the most rigid of
      voices, as she saw yielding in her father&rsquo;s face; if any one had to
      forgive, it was poor Lucy and Algernon. All we have to do, is to be on our
      guard for the future.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sophy is right,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal; &lsquo;intimacy must be over with one who has
      so little discretion or good taste.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then after his saving Maurice, he is to be given up, because he quizzed
      the Polysyllable?&rsquo; cried Albinia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do not give him up,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal. &lsquo;I highly esteem his good
      qualities, and should be happy to do him a service, but I cannot have my
      family at the mercy of his wit, nor my child taught disrespect. We have
      been unwisely familiar, and must retreat.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what do you mean us to do?&rsquo; exclaimed Albinia. &lsquo;Are we to cut him
      systematically?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do not know what course you may adopt,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal, in a tone
      whose grave precision rebuked her half petulant, half facetious inquiry.
      &lsquo;I have told you that I do not mean to do anything extravagant, nor to
      discontinue ordinary civilities, but I think you will find that our former
      habits are not resumed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And Maurice must not be always with him,&rsquo; said Sophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly not; I shall keep the boy with myself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was with the greatest effort that Albinia held her tongue. To have
      Sophy not only making common cause against her, but inciting her father to
      interfere about Maurice, was well-nigh intolerable, and she only endured
      it by sealing her lips as with a bar of iron.
    </p>
    <p>
      By-and-by came the reflection that if poor Sophy had a secret cause of
      bitterness, it was she herself who had given those thoughts substance and
      consciousness, and she quickly forgave every one save herself and
      Algernon.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to her little traitor son, she took him seriously in hand at bedtime,
      and argued the whole transaction with him, representing the dreadful
      consequences of meddling with people&rsquo;s private papers under trust. Here
      was poor Lucy taken away from home, and papa made very angry with Ulick,
      because Maurice had been meddlesome and mischievous; and though he had not
      been beaten for it, he would find it a worse punishment not to be trusted
      another time, nor allowed to be with Ulick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maurice turned round with mouth open at hearing of papa&rsquo;s anger with
      Ulick, and the accusation of having brought his friend into trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, Maurice, you remember how unhappy we were, Gilbert and all. It was
      because it was sadly wrong of Gilbert and Lucy to have let Algernon in
      without papa&rsquo;s knowing it, and it was not right or friendly in Ulick to
      laugh at what was so wrong, and grieved us all so much.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was such fun,&rsquo; said Maurice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, Maurice; but fun is no excuse for doing what is unkind and
      mischievous. Ulick would not have been amused if he had cared as much for
      us as we thought he did, but, after all, his drawing the picture would
      have done no harm but for a little boy, whom he trusted, never thinking
      that an unkind wish to tease, would betray this foolish action, and set
      his best friends against him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I did not know I should,&rsquo; said Maurice, winking hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No; you did not know you were doing what, if you were older, would have
      been dishonourable.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      That word was too much! First he hid his face from his mother, and cried
      out fiercely, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve not&mdash;I&rsquo;ve not been that and clenched his fist.
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t say it, mamma.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you had known what you were doing, it would have been dishonourable,&rsquo; 
      she repeated, gravely. &lsquo;It will be a long time before you earn trust and
      confidence again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a great struggle with his tears. She had punished him, and
      almost more than she could bear to see, but she knew the conquest must be
      secured, and she tried, while she caressed him, to make him look at the
      real cause of his lapse; he declared that it was &lsquo;such fun&rsquo; to provoke
      Algernon, and a little more brought out a confession of the whole course
      of persecution, the child&rsquo;s voice becoming quite triumphant as he told of
      the success of his tricks, and his mother, though appalled at their
      audacity, with great difficulty hindering herself from manifesting her
      amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not wonder at Algernon&rsquo;s having found it intolerable, and though
      angry with him for having made himself such fair game, she set to work to
      impress upon Maurice his own errors, and the hatefulness of practical
      jokes, and she succeeded so far as to leave him crying himself to sleep,
      completely subdued, while she felt as if all the tears ought to have been
      shed by herself for her want of vigilance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conflicting duties! how hard to strike the balance! She had readily given
      up her own pleasures for the care of Mrs. Meadows, but when it came to her
      son&rsquo;s training, it was another question.
    </p>
    <p>
      She much wished to see the note with which Mr. Kendal returned the
      unfortunate sketch, but one of the points on which he was sensitive, was
      the sacredness of his correspondence, and all that she heard was, that
      Ulick had answered &lsquo;not at all as Mr. Kendal had expected; he was nothing
      but an Irishman, after all.&rsquo; But at last she obtained a sight of the note.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                                       &lsquo;Bayford, Nov. 20th, 1854.
‘Dear Sir,
</pre>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was much astonished at the contents of your letter of this morning, and
      greatly concerned that Mr. Cavendish Dusautoy should have done so much
      honour to any production of mine, as to alter his arrangements on that
      account.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As the scrawl in question was not meant to meet the eye of any living
      being, I should, for my own part, have considered it proper to take no
      notice of what was betrayed by mere accident. I should have considered it
      more conducive to confidence between gentlemen. I fully acquiesce in what
      you say of the cessation of our former terms of acquaintance, and with
      many thanks for past kindness, believe me,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                                      &lsquo;Your obedient servant,
                                            &lsquo;U. O&rsquo;MORE.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      Nothing was more evidently written in a passion at the invasion of these
      private papers, and Albinia, though she had always feared he might
      consider himself the aggrieved party, had hardly expected so much proud
      irritation and so little regret. Mr. Kendal called him &lsquo;foolish boy,&rsquo; and
      tried to put the matter aside, but he was much hurt, and Ulick put himself
      decidedly in the wrong by passing in the street with a formal bow, when
      Mr. Kendal, according to his purpose of ordinary civility without an open
      rupture, would have shaken hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy looked white, stern, and cold, but said not a word; she deepened her
      father&rsquo;s displeasure quite sufficiently by her countenance. His was grave
      disappointment in a youth whom he found less grateful than he thought he
      had a right to expect; hers was the rankling of what she deemed an insult
      to her sister, and the festering of a wound of which she was ashamed. She
      meant to bear it well, but it made her very hard and rigid, and even the
      children could hardly extract a smile from her. She seemed to have made a
      determination to do all that Lucy or herself had ever done, and more too,
      and listened to no entreaties to spare herself. Commands were met with
      sullen resignation, entreaties were unavailing, and both in the sickroom
      and the parish, she insisted on working beyond her powers. It was a
      nightly battle to send her to bed, and Albinia suspected that she did not
      sleep. Meantime Lucy had sailed, and was presently heard of in a whirl of
      excitement that shortened her letters, and made them joyous and
      self-important.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said Sophy, &lsquo;she will soon forget that she ever had a home.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor dear! Wait till trouble comes, and she will remember it only too
      sadly,&rsquo; sighed Albinia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Trouble is certain enough,&rsquo; said Sophy; &lsquo;but I don&rsquo;t think what we
      deserve does us much good.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy could see nothing but the most ungentle and gloomy aspects. Gilbert
      had not yet written, and she was convinced that he was either very ill, or
      had only recovered to be killed at Inkermann, and she would only sigh at
      the Gazette that announced Lieutenant Gilbert Kendal&rsquo;s promotion to be
      Captain, and Major the Honourable Frederick Ferrars to be
      Lieutenant-Colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day after, however, came the long expected letter from the captain
      himself. It was to Mrs. Kendal, and she detected a shade of disappointment
      on her husband&rsquo;s face, so she would have handed it to him at once, but he
      said, &lsquo;No, the person to whom the letter is addressed, should always be
      the first to read it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter began with Gilbert&rsquo;s happiness in those from home, which he
      called the greatest pleasure he had ever known. He feared he had caused
      uneasiness by not writing sooner, but it had been out of his power while
      Fred Ferrars was in danger. Then followed the account of the severe
      illness from which Fred was scarcely beginning to rally, though that
      morning, on hearing that he was to be sent home as soon as he could move,
      he had talked about Canada and Emily. Gilbert said that not only time but
      strength had been wanting for writing, for attendance on Fred had been all
      that he could attempt, since moving produced so much pain and loss of
      breath, that he had been forced to be absolutely still whenever he was not
      wanted, but he was now much better. &lsquo;Though,&rsquo; he continued, &lsquo;I do not now
      mind telling you that I had thought myself gone. You, who have known all
      my feelings, and have borne with them so kindly, will understand the
      effect upon me, when on the night previous to the 25th, I distinctly heard
      my own name, in Edmund&rsquo;s voice, at the head of my bed, just as he used to
      call me when he had finished his lessons, and wanted me to come out with
      him. As I started up, I heard it again outside the tent. I ran to the
      door, but of course there was nothing, nor did poor Wynne hear anything. I
      lay awake for some time, but slept at last, and had forgotten all by
      morning. It did not even occur to me when I saw the pleasant race they had
      cut out for us, nor through the whole affair. Do not ask me to describe
      it, the scene haunts me enough. When I found that I had not come off
      unhurt, and it seemed as if I could not ask for one of our fellows but to
      hear he was dead or dying, poor Wynne among them, then the voice seemed a
      summons. I was thoroughly done up, and could not even speak when General
      Ferrars came to me; I only wanted to be let alone to die in peace. I fancy
      I slept, for the next thing I heard was the Major&rsquo;s voice asking for some
      water, too feebly to wake the fellow who had been left in charge. I got
      up, and found him in a state of high fever and great pain, and from that
      time to the present, I have hardly thought of the circumstance, and know
      not why I have now written it to you. Did my danger actually bring Edmund
      nearer, or did its presence act on my imagination? Be that as it may, I
      think, after the first impression of awe and terror, the having heard the
      dear old voice braced me, and gave me a sense of being near home and less
      lonely. Not that my hurt has been for an instant dangerous, and I am
      mending every day; if it were warmer I should get on faster, but I cannot
      stir into the air without bringing on cough. Tell Ulick O&rsquo;More that we
      entertained his brother at tea last evening, we were obliged to desire him
      to bring his own cup, and he produced the shell of a land tortoise; it was
      very like the fox and the crane. Poor fellow, it was the first good meal
      he had for weeks, and I was glad he came in for some famous bread that the
      General had sent us in. He made us much more merry than was convenient to
      either of us, not being in condition for laughing. He is a fine lad, and
      liked by all.&rsquo; Then came a break, and the letter closed with such tidings
      of Inkermann as had reached the invalid&rsquo;s tent.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few lines from General Ferrars spoke of the improvement in both
      patients, adding that Fred had had a hard struggle for his life, and had
      only been saved, by Gilbert&rsquo;s unremitting care by day and night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heroism had not transformed Gilbert, and Albinia&rsquo;s old fondness glowed
      with double ardour as she mused over his history of the battle-eve. His
      father attributed the impression to a mind full of presage and excitement,
      acted upon by strong memory; but woman-like, Albinia preferred the belief
      that the one twin might have been an actual messenger to cheer and
      strengthen the other for the coming trial. Sophy only said, &lsquo;Gilbert&rsquo;s
      fancies as usual.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This was not like fancy,&rsquo; said Albinia. &lsquo;This is an unkind way of taking
      it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is common sense,&rsquo; she bluntly answered. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t see why he should
      think that Edmund has nothing better to do than to call him. It would be
      childish.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia did not reply, disturbed by this display of jealousy and
      harshness, as if every bud of tenderness had been dried up and withered,
      and poor Sophy only wanted to run counter to any obvious sentiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia was grateful for the message which gave her an excuse for seeking
      Ulick out, and endeavouring to conciliate him. Mr. Kendal made no
      objection, and expressed a hope that he might have become reasonable. She
      therefore contrived to waylay him in the November darkness, holding out
      her hand so that he took it at unawares, as if not recollecting that he
      was offended, but in the midst his grasp relaxed, and his head went up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have a message for you from Gilbert about your brother Bryan,&rsquo; she
      said, and he could not defend himself from manifesting eager interest, as
      she told of the tea-party; but that over, it was in stiff formal English
      that he said, &lsquo;I hope you had a good account.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It struck a chill, and she answered, almost imploringly, &lsquo;Gilbert is much
      better, thank you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am glad to hear it;&rsquo; and he was going to bow and pass on, when she
      exclaimed,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ulick, why are we strangers?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was agreed on all hands that things past could not be undone,&rsquo; he
      frigidly replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Too true,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;but I do not think you know how sorry we are for my
      poor little boy&rsquo;s foolish trick.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I owe no displeasure to Maurice. He knew no more what he was doing than
      if he had been a gust of wind; but if the wind had borne a private paper
      to my feet, I would never have acted on the contents.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Unhappily,&rsquo; said Albinia, &lsquo;some revelations, though received against our
      will, cannot help being felt. We saw the drawing before we knew how he
      came by it, and you cannot wonder that it gave pain to find that a scene
      so distressing to us should have furnished you with amusement. It was
      absurd in itself, but we had hoped it was a secret, and it wounded us
      because we thought you would have been tender of our feelings.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t mean that it was fact!&rsquo; cried Ulick, stopping suddenly; and as
      her silence replied, he continued, &lsquo;I give you my word and honour that I
      never imagined there was a word of truth in the farrago old Biddy told me,
      and I&rsquo;ll not deny that I did scrawl the scene down as the very picture of
      a bit of slander. I only wonder I&rsquo;d not brought it to yourself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pray let me hear what she told you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! she said they two had been colloguing together by moonlight, and you
      came home in the midst, and Miss Kendal fainted away, so he catches up the
      ink and throws it over her instead of water, and you and Mr. Kendal came
      in and were mad entirely; and Mr. Kendal threatened to brain him with the
      poker if he did not quit it that instant, and sent Gilbert for a soldier
      for opening the door to him, but you and Lucy went down on your bare knees
      to get him to relent.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I own the poker does throw an air of improbability over the whole.
      Minus that and the knees, I am afraid it is only too true. I suppose it
      got abroad through the servants.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was an unlucky goose-quill that lay so handy,&rsquo; exclaimed Ulick; &lsquo;but
      you may credit me, no eye but my own ever saw the scrawl, nor would have
      seen it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then, Ulick, if we all own that something is to be regretted, why do we
      stand aloof, and persist in quarrelling?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I want no quarrel,&rsquo; said Ulick, stiffly. &lsquo;Mr. Kendal intimated to me that
      he did not wish for my company, and I&rsquo;m not the man to force it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, Ulick, this is not what I hoped from you!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what, Mrs. Kendal, you could talk over the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway
      if you had a mind,&rsquo; said Ulick, with much agitation; &lsquo;but you must not
      talk over me, for your own judgment would be against it. You know what I
      am, and what I came of, and what have I in the world except the honour of
      a gentleman? Mr. Kendal and yourself have been my kindest friends, and
      I&rsquo;ll be grateful to my dying day; but if Mr. Kendal thinks I can submit
      tamely when he resents what he never ought to have noticed, why, then,
      what have I to do but to show him the difference? If his kindness was to
      me as a gentleman and his equal, I love and bless him for it, but if it be
      a patronizing of the poor clerk, why, then, I owe it to myself and my
      people to show that I can stand alone, without cringing, and being
      thankful for affronts.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did it ever occur to you to think whether pride be a sin?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&rsquo;Tis not pride!&rsquo; cried Ulick. It is my duty to my family and my name.
      You&rsquo;d say yourself, as you allowed before now, that it would be mere
      meanness and servility to swallow insults for one&rsquo;s own profit; and if I
      were to say &ldquo;you&rsquo;re welcome, with many thanks, to shuffle over my private
      papers, and call myself to account,&rdquo; I&rsquo;d better have given up my name at
      once, for I&rsquo;d have left the gentleman behind me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do believe it is solely for the O&rsquo;Mores that you are making a duty of
      implacability!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is a duty not to run from one&rsquo;s word, and debase oneself for one&rsquo;s own
      advantage.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One would think some wonderful advantage was held out to you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The pleasantest hours of my life,&rsquo; murmured he sadly, under his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, Ulick,&rsquo; she said, holding out her hand, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not quite
      dissatisfied; I think some day even an O&rsquo;More will see that there is no
      exception from the law of forgiveness in their special favour, and that
      you will not be able to go on resenting what we have suffered from the
      young of the spider-monkey.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Even this allusion produced no outward effect; he only shook hands
      gravely, saying, &lsquo;I never did otherwise than forgive, and regret the
      consequences: I am very thankful for all your past kindness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Worse than the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway, thought Albinia as she parted from him.
      Nothing is so hopeless as that sort of forgiveness, because it satisfies
      the conscience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kendal predicted that, the Keltic dignity having been asserted, good
      sense and principle would restore things to a rational footing. What this
      meant might be uncertain, but he certainly missed Prometheus, and found
      Maurice a poor substitute. Indulgence itself could hardly hold out in
      unmitigated intercourse with an obstreperous dunce not seven years old,
      and Maurice, deprived of Gilbert, cut off from Ulick, with mamma busy, and
      Sophy out of spirits, underwent more snubbing than had ever yet fallen to
      his lot. Not that he was much concerned thereat; and Mr. Kendal would
      resume his book after a lecture upon good manners, and then be roused to
      find his library a gigantic cobweb, strings tied to every leg of table or
      chair, and Maurice and the little Awk enacting spider and fly, heedless of
      the unwilling flies who might suffer by their trap. Such being the case,
      his magnanimity was the less amazing when he said, &lsquo;Albinia, there is no
      reason that O&rsquo;More should not eat his Christmas dinner here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well. I trust he will not think it needful still to be
      self-denying.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is not our part to press advances which are repelled,&rsquo; said Sophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed, Sophy,&rsquo; said her father, smiling, &lsquo;I see nothing attractive in
      the attitude of rocks rent asunder.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The undesigned allusion must have gone deep, for she coloured to a purple
      crimson, and said in a freezing tone, &lsquo;I thought you considered that to
      take him up again would be a direct insult to Lucy and her husband.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They do not show much consideration for us,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal. &lsquo;How long
      ago was the date of her last letter?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nearly three weeks,&rsquo; said Albinia. &lsquo;Poor child, how could she write with
      the catalogue raisonnee of the Louvre to learn by heart?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Dusautoys yearly gave a Christmas tea-party to the teachers in the
      Sunday-school, who had of late become more numerous, as Mr. Dusautoy&rsquo;s
      influence had had more time to tell. Mrs. Kendal was reckoned on as one of
      the chief supporters of the gaiety of the evening, but on this occasion
      she was forced to send Sophia alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy regarded it as a duty and a penance, and submitted the more readily
      because it was so distasteful. It was, however, more than she had reckoned
      on to find that the party had been extended to the male teachers, an
      exceedingly good and lugubrious-looking youth lately apprenticed to Mr.
      Bowles, and Ulick O&rsquo;More. It was the first time she had met the latter
      since his offence. She avoided seeing him as long as possible, though all
      his movements seemed to thrill her, and so confused the conversation which
      she was trying to keep up, that she found herself saying that Genevieve
      Durant had lost an arm, and that Gilbert would spend Christmas in London.
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt him coming nearer; she knew he was passing the Miss Northover in
      the purple silk and red neck-ribbon; she heard him exchanging a few civil
      words with the sister with the hair strained off her face; she knew he was
      coming; she grew more eager in her fears for Mr. Rainsforth&rsquo;s chest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tea was announced. Sophy held back in the general move, Ulick made a step
      nearer, their eyes met, and if ever eyes spoke, hers ordered him to keep
      his distance, while he glanced affront for affront, bowed and stepped
      back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy sat by Miss Jane Northover, and endeavoured to make her talk.
      Anything would have been better than the echoes of the sprightliness at
      the lower end of the table, where Ulick was talking what he would have
      called blarney to Miss Susan Northover and Miss Mary Anne Higgins, both at
      once, till he excited them into a perpetual giggle. Mr. Dusautoy was
      delighted, and evidently thought this brilliant success; Mrs. Dusautoy was
      less at her ease&mdash;the mirth was less sober and more exclusive than
      she had intended; and Sophy, finding nothing could be made of Miss Jane,
      turned round to her other neighbour, Mr. Hope, and asked his opinion of
      the Whewell and Brewster controversy on the Plurality of Worlds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hope had rather a good opinion of Miss Sophia, and as she had never
      molested him, could talk to her, so he straightway became engrossed in the
      logical and theological aspects of the theory; and Mrs. Dusautoy could
      hardly suppress her smile at this unconscious ponderous attempt at a
      counter flirtation, with Saturn and Jupiter as weapons for light
      skirmishing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ulick received the invitation to dinner, and did not accept it. He said he
      had an engagement&mdash;Albinia wondered what it could be, and had reason
      afterwards to think that he had the silent young apothecary to a Christmas
      dinner in his own rooms&mdash;an act of charity at least, if not of
      forgiveness. Mr. Johns, the senior clerk, whose health had long been
      failing, was about to retire, and this announcement was followed by the
      appearance of a smart, keen-looking young man of six or seven-and-twenty,
      whom Miss Goldsmith paraded as her cousin, Mr. Andrew Goldsmith, and it
      was generally expected that he would be taken into partnership, and
      undertake old John&rsquo;s work, but in a fortnight he disappeared, and young
      O&rsquo;More was promoted to the vacant post with an increase of salary. It was
      mortifying only to be informed through Mr. Dusautoy, instead of by the lad
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Eastern letters were the chief comfort. First came tidings that
      Gilbert, not having yet recovered his contusion, was to accompany Colonel
      Ferrars to Scutari, and then after a longer interval came a brief and
      joyous note&mdash;Gilbert was coming home! On his voyage from the Crimea
      he had caught cold, and this had brought on severe inflammation on the
      injured chest, which had laid him by for many days at Scutari. The colonel
      had become the stronger of the two, in spite of a fragment of shell lodged
      so deeply in the side, that the medical board advised his going to London
      for its removal. Both were ordered home together with six months&rsquo; leave,
      and Gilbert&rsquo;s note overflowed with glad messages to all, including
      Algernon, of whose departure he was still in ignorance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kendal knew not whether he was most gratified or discomfited by the
      insinuating ringer who touched his hat, hoping for due notice of the
      captain&rsquo;s arrival in time to welcome him with a peal of bells. Indeed,
      Bayford was so excited about its hero, that there were symptoms of plans
      for a grand reception with speeches, cheers, and triumphal arches, which
      caused Sophy to say she hoped that he would come suddenly without any
      notice, so as to put a stop to all that nonsense; while Albinia could not
      help nourishing a strange vague expectation that his return would be the
      beginning of better days.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, Sophia, with a touch of the old penny club fever, toiled over the
      school clothing wilfully and unnecessarily for two hours, kept up till
      evening without owning to the pain in her back, but finally returned so
      faint and dizzy that she was forced to be carried helpless to her room,
      and the next day could barely drag herself to the couch in the
      morning-room, where she lay quite prostrated, and grieved at increasing
      instead of lessening her mother&rsquo;s cares.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, mamma, don&rsquo;t stay with me. You are much too busy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I am not. The children are out, and grandmamma asleep, and I am going
      to write to Lucy, but there&rsquo;s no hurry. Let me cool your forehead a little
      longer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How I hate being another bother!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I like you much better so, than when you would not let me speak to you,
      my poor child.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I could not,&rsquo; she said, stifling her voice on the cushion, and averting
      her head; but in a few moments she made a great effort, and said, &lsquo;You
      think me unforgiving, mamma. It was not entirely that. It was hating
      myself for an old fancy, a mere mistake. I have got over it; and I will
      not be in error again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sophy dear, if you find strength in pride, it will only wound yourself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do not think I am proud,&rsquo; said Sophy, quietly. &lsquo;I may have been
      headstrong, but I despise myself too much for pride.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you sure it was mere fancy? It was an idea that occurred to more than
      to you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush!&rsquo; cried Sophy. &lsquo;Had it been so, could he have ridiculed Lucy? Could
      he have flown out so against papa? No; that caricature undeceived me, and
      I am thankful. He treated us as cousins&mdash;no more&mdash;he would act
      in the same manner by any of the Miss O&rsquo;Mores of Ballymakilty, nay, by
      Jane Northover herself. We did not allow for Irish manner.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If so, he had no right to do so. I shall never wish to see him here
      again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, mamma, he did not know the folly he had to deal with. Next time I
      meet him, I shall know how to be really indifferent. Now, this is the last
      time we will mention the subject!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia obeyed, but still hoped. It was well that hope remained, for her
      task was heavier than ever; Mrs. Meadows was feebler, but more restless
      and wakeful, asking twenty times in an hour for Mrs. Kendal. The doctors
      thought it impossible that she should hold out another fortnight, but she
      lived on from day to day, and at times Albinia hardly could be absent from
      her for ten minutes together. Sophy was so completely knocked up that she
      could barely creep about the house, and was forbidden the sick-room; but
      she was softened and gentle, and was once more a companion to her father,
      while eagerly looking forward to devoting herself to Gilbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      A letter with the Malta post-mark was eagerly opened, as the harbinger of
      his speedy arrival.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                                        &lsquo;Royal Hotel, Malta,
                                            February 10th, 1855.
</pre>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dearest Mrs. Kendal,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am afraid you will all be much disappointed, though your grief cannot
      equal mine at the Doctor&rsquo;s cruel decree. We arrived here the day before
      yesterday, but I had been so ill all the voyage with pain in the side and
      cough, that there was no choice but to land, and call in Dr.&mdash;&mdash;,
      who tells me that my broken rib has damaged my lungs so much, that I must
      keep perfectly quiet, and not think of going home till warm weather. If I
      am well enough to join by that time, I shall not see you at all unless you
      and my father could come out. Am I nourishing too wild a hope in thinking
      it possible? Since Lucy has been so kind as to promise never to leave
      grandmamma, I cannot help hoping you might be spared. I do not think my
      proposal is selfish, since my poor grandmother is so little conscious of
      your cares; and Ferrars insists on remaining with me till he sees me in
      your hands, though they say that the splinter must be extracted in London,
      and every week he remains here is so much suffering, besides delaying his
      expedition to Canada. I have entreated him to hasten on, but he will not
      hear of it. He is like a brother or a father to me, and nurses me most
      tenderly, when he ought to be nursed himself. We are famishing for
      letters. I suppose all ours have gone up to Balaklava, and thence will be
      sent to England. If we were but there! We are both much better for the
      quiet of these two days, and are to move to-morrow to a lodging that a
      friend of Fred&rsquo;s has taken for us at Bormola, so as to be out of the Babel
      of these streets&mdash;we stipulated that it should be large enough to
      take in you and my father. I wish Sophy and the children would come too&mdash;it
      would do them all the good in the world; and Maurice would go crazy among
      the big guns; I am only afraid we should have him enlisting as a drummer.
      The happy pair would be very glad to have the house to themselves, and
      would persuade themselves that it was another honeymoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good-bye. Instead of looking for a letter, I shall come down to meet you
      at the Quarantine harbour. Love to all.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                                      &lsquo;Your most affectionate
                                           &lsquo;GILBERT KENDAL.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      How differently Gilbert wrote when really ill, from his desponding style
      when he only fancied himself so, thought Albinia, as, perplexed and
      grieved, she handed the letter to her husband, and opened the enclosure,
      written in the laboured, ill-formed characters of a left-hand not yet
      accustomed to doing the offices of both.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear Albinia,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come, if possible. His heart is set upon it, though he does not realize
      his condition, and I cannot bear to tell him. Only the utmost care can
      save him. I am doing my best for him, but my nursing is as left-handed as
      my writing.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                                           &lsquo;Ever yours,
                                               &lsquo;F.F.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      His wife&rsquo;s look of horror was Mr. Kendal&rsquo;s preparation for this emphatic
      summons, perhaps a shock less sudden to him than to her, for he had not
      been without misgivings ever since he had heard of the situation of the
      injury. He read and spoke not, till the silence became intolerable, and
      she burst out almost with a scream, &lsquo;Oh! Edmund, I knew not what I did
      when I took grandmamma into this house!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is very perplexing,&rsquo; he said, his feelings so intense that he dared
      only speak of acting; &lsquo;I must set out to-night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Order me to come with you,&rsquo; she said breathlessly. &lsquo;That will cancel
      everything else.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Would Mrs. Drury take charge of her aunt?&rsquo; said he, with a moment&rsquo;s
      hesitation; and Albinia felt it implied his impression that they were
      bound by her repeated promises never to quit the invalid, but she only
      spoke the more vehemently&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mrs Drury? She might&mdash;she would, under the circumstances. She could
      not refuse. If you desire me to come, I should not be doing wrong; and
      grandmamma might never even miss me. Surely&mdash;oh surely, a young life,
      full of hope and promise, that may yet be saved, is not to be set against
      what cannot be prolonged more than a few weeks.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As to that,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal, in the deliberate tone which denoted
      dissatisfaction, &lsquo;though of course it would be the greatest blessing to
      have you with us, I think you may trust Gilbert to my care. And we must
      consider poor Sophia.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She could not bear to be considered.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No; but it would be leaving her in a most distressing position, when she
      is far from well, and with most uncongenial assistants. You see, poor
      Gilbert reckons on Lucy being here, which would make it very different.
      But think of poor Sophia in the event of Mrs. Meadows not surviving till
      our return!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are right! It would half kill her! My promise was sacred; I was a
      wretch to think of breaking it. But when I think of my boy&mdash;my
      Gilbert pining for me, and I deserting him&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For the sake of duty,&rsquo; said her husband. &lsquo;Let us do right, and trust that
      all will be overruled for the best. I shall go with an easier mind if I
      leave you with the other children, and I can be the sooner with him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I could travel as fast.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I may soon bring him home to you. Or you might bring the others to join
      us in the south of France. You will all need change.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The decision was made, and her judgment acquiesced, though she could
      hardly have cast the balance for herself. She urged no more, even when
      relentings came over her husband at the thought of the trials to which he
      was leaving her, and of those which he should meet in solitude; yet not
      without a certain secret desire to make himself sufficient for the care
      and contentment of his own son. He cast about for all possible helpers for
      her, but could devise nothing except a note entreating her brother to be
      with her as much as possible, and commending her to the Dusautoys. It was
      a less decided kindness that he ordered Maurice&rsquo;s pony to be turned out to
      grass, so as to prevent rides in solitude, thinking the boy too young to
      be trusted, and warned by the example of Gilbert&rsquo;s temptations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Going up to the bank to obtain a supply of gold, he found young O&rsquo;More
      there without his uncle. The tidings of Gilbert&rsquo;s danger had spread
      throughout the town, and one heart at least was softened. Ulick wrung the
      hand that lately he would not touch, and Mr. Kendal forgot his wrath as he
      replied to the warm-hearted inquiry for particulars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then Mrs. Kendal cannot go with you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, it is impossible. There is no one able to take charge of Mrs.
      Meadows.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! and Mrs. Cavendish Dusautoy is gone! I grieve for the hour when my
      pen got the better of me. Mr. Kendal, this is worse than I thought. Your
      son will never forgive me when he knows I&rsquo;m at the bottom of his
      disappointment.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is something to forgive on all hands,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal. &lsquo;That
      meddlesome boy of mine has caused worse results than we could have
      contemplated. I believe it has been a lesson to him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know it has to some one else,&rsquo; said Ulick. &lsquo;I wish I could do anything!
      It would be the greatest comfort you could give me to tell me of a thing I
      could do for Gilbert or any of you. If you&rsquo;d send me to find Mr. Cavendish
      Dusautoy, and tell him &lsquo;twas all my fault, and bring them back&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Rather too wild a project, thank you,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal, smiling. &lsquo;No; the
      only thing you could do, would be&mdash;if that boy of mine have not
      completely forfeited your kindness&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Maurice! Ah! how I have missed the rogue.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor little fellow, I am afraid he may be a burthen to himself and every
      one else. It would be a great relief if you could be kind enough now and
      then to give him the pleasure of a walk.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Maurice did not attend greatly to papa&rsquo;s permission to go out with Mr.
      O&rsquo;More. Either it was clogged with too many conditions of discretion, and
      too many reminiscences of the past; or Maurice&rsquo;s mind was too much bent on
      the thought of his brother. Both children haunted the packing up,
      entreating to send out impossible presents. Maurice could hardly be
      persuaded out of contributing a perilous-looking boomerang, which he
      argued had some sense in it; while he scoffed at the little Awk, who stood
      kissing and almost crying over the china countenance of her favourite
      doll, entreating that papa would take dear Miss Jenny because Gibbie loved
      her the best of all, and always put her to sleep on his knees. At last
      matters were compromised by Sophy, who roused herself to do one of the few
      things for which she had strength, engrossing them by cutting out in paper
      an interminable hunt with horses and dogs adhering together by the noses
      and tails, which, when brilliantly painted according to their united
      taste, they might safely imagine giving pleasure to Gilbert, while, at any
      rate, it would do no harm in papa&rsquo;s pocket-book.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The day after Mr. Kendal&rsquo;s departure, Mrs. Meadows had another attack, but
      a fortnight still passed before the long long task was over and the weary
      spirit set free. There had been no real consciousness and no one could
      speak of regret; of anything but relief and thankfulness that release had
      come at last, when Albinia had redeemed her pledge and knew she should no
      more hear of the dreary &lsquo;very bad night,&rsquo; nor be greeted by the low,
      restless moan. The long good-night was come, and, on the whole, there was
      peace and absence of self-condemnation in looking back on the past
      connexion. Forbearance and unselfishness were recompensed by the calm
      tenderness with which she could regard one who at the outset had appeared
      likely to cause nothing but frets and misunderstandings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had she and Sophy been left to themselves, there would have been nothing
      to break upon this frame of mind, but early the next day arrived Mr. and
      Mrs. Drury, upsetting all her arrangements, implying that it had been
      presumptuous to exert any authority without relationship. It did seem hard
      that the claims of kindred should be only recollected in order to unsettle
      her plans, and offend her unostentatious tastes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Averse both to the proposals, and to the discussion, she felt unprotected
      and forlorn, but her spirit revived as she heard her brother&rsquo;s voice in
      the hall, and she hastened to put herself in his hands. He declined doing
      battle, he said it would be better to yield than to argue, and leave a
      grudge for ever. &lsquo;It will not vex Edmund,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;and though you and
      Sophy may be pained by incongruities, they will hurt you less than
      disputing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt that he was right, and by yielding the main points he contrived
      amicably to persuade Mr. Drury out of the numerous invitations and grand
      luncheon as well as to adhere to the day that she had originally fixed for
      the funeral, after which he hoped to take her and the young ones home with
      him and give her the thorough change and rest of which the over-energy of
      her manner betrayed the need.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not that she consented. She could not bear not to meet her letters at
      once; or suppose Edmund and Gilbert should return to an empty, unaired
      house, and she thought herself selfish, when it might do so much good to
      Sophy, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.&mdash;till Mr. Ferrars, going home for a
      night, agreed with Winifred, that domineering would be the only way to
      deal with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his return he found Albinia on the stairs, and boxes and trunks carried
      down after her. Running to him, she exclaimed, abruptly, &lsquo;I am going to
      Malta, Maurice, to-morrow evening!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Has Edmund sent for you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not exactly&mdash;he did not know&mdash;but Gilbert is dying, and
      wretched at my not coming. I never wished him good-by&mdash;he thinks I
      did not forgive him. Don&rsquo;t say a word&mdash;I shall go.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He held her trembling hands, and said, &lsquo;This is not the way to be able to
      go. Come in here, sit down and tell me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is no use to argue. It is my duty now,&rsquo; said Albinia; but she let him
      lead her into the room, where Sophy was changing the bright border of a
      travelling-cloak to crape, and Maurice stood watching, as if stunned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is settled,&rsquo; continued she, rapidly. &lsquo;Sophy and the children go to the
      vicarage. Yes, I know, you are very kind, but Maurice would be
      troublesome, and Winifred is not well enough, and the Dusautoys wish it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, that may be the best plan, as I shall be absent.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned round, startled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I cannot let you go alone.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nonsense&mdash;Winifred&mdash;Sunday&mdash;Lent&mdash;I don&rsquo;t want any
      one. Nothing could happen to me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ferrars caught Sophy&rsquo;s eye beaming with sudden relief and gratitude,
      and repeated, &lsquo;If you go, I must take you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t wait for Sunday,&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What have you heard?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She produced the letter, and read parts of it. The whole stood thus:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bormola, 11 p.m., February 28th, 1855.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dearest Albinia,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope all has gone fairly well with you in my absence, and that Sophia
      is well again. Could I have foreseen the condition of affairs here, I
      doubt whether I could have resolved on leaving you at home, though you may
      be spared much by not being with us. I landed at noon to-day, and was met
      in the harbour by your cousin, who had come off in a boat in hopes of
      finding you on board. He did his best to prepare me for Gilbert&rsquo;s
      appearance, but I was more shocked than I can express. There can no longer
      be any doubt that it is a case of rapid decline, brought on by exposure,
      and, aggravated by the injury at Balaklava. Colonel Ferrars fancies that
      Gilbert&rsquo;s exertions on his behalf in the early part of his illness may
      have done harm, by preventing the broken bone from uniting, and causing it
      to press on the lungs; but knowing the constitutional tendency, we need
      not dwell on secondary causes, and there is no one to whom we owe a deeper
      debt of gratitude than to your cousin, for his most assiduous and
      affectionate attendance at a time when he is very little equal to
      exertion. They are like brothers together, and I am sure nothing has been
      wanting to Gilbert that he could devise for his comfort. They are in a
      tolerably commodious airy lodging, where I found Gilbert propped up with
      cushions on a large chair by the window, flushed with eager watching. Poor
      fellow, to see how his countenance fell when he found I was alone, was the
      most cutting reproach I ever received in my life. He was so completely
      overcome, that he could not restrain his tears, though he strove hard to
      command himself in this fear of wounding my feelings; but there are
      moments when the truth will have its way, and you have been more to him
      than his father has ever been. May it be granted that he may yet know how
      I feel towards him! His first impression was that you had never forgiven
      him for his unfortunate adventure with Maurice, and could never feel
      towards him as before; and though I trust I have removed this idea,
      perhaps such a letter as you can write might set his heart at rest.
      Ferrars says that hitherto his spirits have kept up wonderfully, though
      latterly he had been evidently aware of his condition, but he has been
      very much depressed this evening, probably from the reaction of excited
      expectation. On learning the cause of Lucy&rsquo;s desertion, he seemed to
      consider that his participation in the transactions of that night had
      recoiled upon himself, and deprived him of your presence. It was very
      painful to see how he took it. He was eager to be told of the children,
      and the only time I saw him brighten was when I gave him their messages. I
      am writing while I hope he sleeps. I am glad to be here to relieve the
      Colonel, who for several nights past has slept on the floor, in his room,
      not thinking the Maltese servant trustworthy. He looks very ill and
      suffering, but seems to have no thought but for Gilbert, and will not hear
      of leaving him; and, in truth, they cling together so affectionately, that
      I could not bear to urge their parting, even were Fred more fit to travel
      home alone. I will close my letter to-morrow after the doctor&rsquo;s visit.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The conclusion was even more desponding; the physician had spoken of the
      case as hopeless, and likely to terminate rapidly; and Gilbert, who was
      always at the worst in the morning, had shown no symptom that could lead
      his father to retract his first impression.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ferrars saw that it would be useless and cruel to endeavour to detain
      his sister, and only doubted whether in her precipitation, she might not
      cross and miss her husband in a still sadder journey homeward, and this
      made him the more resolved to be her escort. When she dissuaded him
      vehemently as though she were bent on doing something desperate, he
      replied that he was anxious about Fred, and if she and her husband were
      engrossed by their son, he should be of service in bringing him home; and
      this somewhat reconciled her to what was so much to her benefit. Only she
      gave notice that he must not prevent her from travelling day and night, to
      which he made no answer, while Sophy hoarsely said that but for knowing
      herself to be a mere impediment, she should have insisted on going, and
      her uncle must not keep mamma back. Then Maurice imitatively broke out,
      &lsquo;Mamma, take me to Gilbert, I wont be a plague, I promise you.&rsquo; He was
      scarcely silenced before Mr. Dusautoy came striding in to urge on her that
      Fanny and himself should be much happier if he were permitted to conduct
      Mrs. Kendal to Malta (the fact being that Fanny was persuaded that Mr.
      Ferrars would obviate such necessity). Albinia almost laughed, as she had
      declared that she had set all the parsons in the country in commotion, and
      Mr. Dusautoy was obliged to limit his good offices to the care of the
      children, and the responsibility of the Fairmead Sunday services.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good hard-worked brother had hardly time to eat his luncheon, before
      he started to inform his wife, and prepare for his journey. Winifred was a
      very good sister on an emergency; she had not once growled since poor Mrs.
      Meadows had been really ill; and though she had been feeding on hopes of
      Albinia&rsquo;s visit, and was far from strong, she quashed her husband&rsquo;s
      misgivings, and cheerily strove to convince him that he would be wanted by
      no one, least of all by herself. A slight vituperation of the polysyllabic
      pair was all the relief she permitted herself, and who could blame her for
      that, when even Mr. Dusautoy called the one &lsquo;that foolish fellow,&rsquo; and the
      other &lsquo;poor dear Lucy?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia and Sophy safe over the fire that evening, after their sorrowful
      tasks unable to turn to anything else, wondering how and when they should
      meet again, and their words coming slowly, and with long intervals of
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear child,&rsquo; said Albinia, &lsquo;promise me to take care of yourself, and to
      let Mrs. Dusautoy judge what you can do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not worth taking care of,&rsquo; muttered Sophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We think you worth our anxiety,&rsquo; said Albinia, tenderly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will not make it worse for you,&rsquo; meekly replied Sophy. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think
      I&rsquo;m cross now, I could not be&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, indeed you are not, my dear. We have leant on each other, and when we
      come home, you will make our welcome.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The children will.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! I think Maurice will behave well. He is very much subdued. I told him
      he was to do no lessons, and he fairly burst out crying.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, mamma!&rsquo; exclaimed Sophy, hurt, indignant, and nearly ready to follow
      his example.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do not think he has mastery over himself, so as to help being unruly
      and idle, when he is chained to a spelling-book. I would not for the world
      set him and you to worry each other for an hour a day, and I shall start
      afresh with him all the better, when he knows what absence of lessons is,
      and has forgotten all the old associations.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How could you make him cry?&rsquo; said Sophy, in reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I believe the tears only wanted an excuse. I <i>did</i> put it on his
      naughtiness, which usually would have elated him; but his heart was so
      full as to make even a long holiday a punishment. That boy often shows me
      what a thorough Kendal he is; things sink into him as they never did into
      us at the same age, when my aunts used to think I had no feeling. Oh,
      Sophy! how will you comfort him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;His will be an unstained sorrow,&rsquo; said Sophy, from the depths of her
      heart. &lsquo;O, mamma, only tell Gilbert what you know I feel&mdash;no, you
      don&rsquo;t, no one can, but what I would not give, to change all I have felt
      towards him? If I had been like Edmund, and prized his gentleness and
      sweetness, and the humility that was the best worth of all, how different
      it would be! But I was proud of despising where truth was wanting.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should have thought I should have done the same,&rsquo; said Albinia; but
      there was no keeping from loving Gibbie. Besides, he was sincere, except
      when he was afraid, and he was miserable when he was deceiving.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, after you came,&rsquo; said Sophy; &lsquo;but I believe I helped him to think
      truth disagreeable. I showed my scorn for his want of boldness, instead of
      helping him. Think of my having fancied <i>he</i> had no courage.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Kindness taught him courage,&rsquo; said Albinia. &lsquo;It might perhaps have
      earlier taught him moral courage. If you and he could have leant against
      each other, and been fused together, you would have made something like
      what Edmund was, I suppose.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I drove him off,&rsquo; cried Sophy. &lsquo;I was no sister to him. Will you bring me
      his forgiveness?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed I will; and you may feel sure of it already, dearest. It will make
      you gentler all your life.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I shall grow harder and harsher the longer I live, and the fewer I
      have to love me in spite of myself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think not,&rsquo; said Albinia. &lsquo;Humility will make your severity more
      gentle, and you will soften, and win love and esteem.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up, but cried, &lsquo;I shall never make up to Gilbert nor to
      grandmamma!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia felt it almost as hard to leave her as the two little ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      When once on her journey, and feeling each moment an advance towards the
      goal, Albinia was less unhappy than she could have thought possible; she
      trusted to her brother, and enjoyed the absence of responsibility, and
      while he let her go on, could give her mind to what pleased and interested
      him, and he, who was an excellent courier, so managed that there were few
      detentions to overthrow her equanimity on the way to Marseilles.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when the Vectis came in sight of the rocky isle, with its white stony
      heights, the heart-sickness of apprehension grew over her, and she saw, as
      in a mist, the noble crescent-shaped harbour, the stately ramparts, mighty
      batteries, the lofty terraces of flat-roofed dwellings, apparently rather
      hewn out of, than built on, the dazzling white stone, between the intense
      blue of the sky above and of the sea below. Her eye roamed as in a dream
      over the crowds of gay boats with white awnings, and the motley crowds of
      English and natives, the boatmen screaming and fighting for the luggage,
      and beggars plaintively whining out their entreaties for small coins. Her
      brother Maurice had been at Malta as a little boy, and remembered the
      habits of the place enough, as soon as they had set foot on shore, to
      secure a brown-skinned loiterer, in Phrygian cap, loose trousers, and
      crimson sash, to act as guide and porter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Along the Strada San Giovanni, a street of stairs, shut in by high stone
      walls, with doors opening on either side, they went not as fast as
      Albinia&rsquo;s quivering limbs would fain have moved, yet too fast when her
      breath came thick with anxiety&mdash;down again by the stone stairs called
      &lsquo;Nix Mangiare&rsquo; (nothing to eat), from the incessant cry of the beggars
      that haunt them&mdash;then again in a boat, which carried them amid a
      strange world of shipping to the bottom of the dockyard creek, where,
      again landing, she was told she had but to ascend, and she would be at
      Bormola.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could have paused, in dread; and she leant heavily on her brother&rsquo;s
      arm when they presently turned up a lane, no broader than a passage, with
      low stone steps at irregular intervals. They were come!
    </p>
    <p>
      The summons at the door was answered by a dark-visaged Maltese, and while
      Maurice was putting the question whether Colonel Ferrars and Captain
      Kendal lived here, a figure appeared on the stairs, and beckoned,
      ascending noiselessly with languid steps and slippered feet, and leading
      the way into a slightly furnished room, with green balcony and striped
      blind. There he turned and held out his hand; but Albinia hardly
      recognised him till he said, &lsquo;I thought I heard your voice, Maurice;&rsquo; and
      then the low subdued tone, together with the gaunt wasted form, haggard
      aged face, the long beard, and worn undress uniform, with the armless
      sleeve, made her so realize his sufferings, that, clasping his remaining
      hand in both her own, she could utter nothing but, &lsquo;Oh! Fred! Fred!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her brother with such inquiry, perplexity, and compassion,
      that almost in despair Maurice exclaimed, &lsquo;We are not too late!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, thank God!&rsquo; said Frederick. &lsquo;We did hope you might come! Sit down,
      Albinia; I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Edmund! Is he there!&rsquo; she said, scarcely alive to what was passing, and
      casting another expressively sorrowful look at Maurice, Fred answered,
      &lsquo;Yes, I will tell him: I will see if you can come in.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stay,&rsquo; said Mr. Ferrars; &lsquo;she should compose herself, or she will only
      hurt herself and Gilbert.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; murmured Fred, hastily leaving them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maurice understood that Gilbert was even then summoned by one who would
      brook no delays; but Albinia, too much agitated to notice slight
      indications, was about to follow, when her brother took her hand, and
      checked her like a child. &lsquo;Wait a minute, my dear, he will soon come
      back.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s Edmund? Why mayn&rsquo;t I go to Gilbert?&rsquo; she said, still bewildered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fred is gone to tell them. Sit down, my dear; take off your bonnet, you
      are heated, you will be better able to go to him, if you are quiet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She passively submitted to be placed on a chair, and to remove her bonnet;
      and seeing some dressing apparatus through an open door, Maurice brought
      her some cold water to refresh her burning face. She looked up with a
      smile, herself again. &lsquo;There thank you, Maurice: I wont be foolish now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;God support you, my dear!&rsquo; said her brother, for the longer the Colonel
      tarried, the worse were his forebodings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps the doctor is there,&rsquo; she proceeded. &lsquo;That will be well. Ask him
      everything, Maurice. But oh! did you ever see any one so much altered as
      poor Fred! He looks twenty years older! Ah! I am quite good now! I may go
      now!&rsquo; she cried, as the door opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as Frederick returned, there was that written on his brow, which
      lifted her out of the childishness of her agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear Albinia,&rsquo; he said in a trembling voice, &lsquo;Mr. Kendal cannot leave
      him to come to you. He has been much worse since last night,&rsquo; and as her
      face showed that she was gathering his meaning, he pursued in a lower and
      more awe-struck tone: &lsquo;We think he is sensible, but we cannot tell. It
      could not hurt him for you to come in, and perhaps he may know you, but
      are you able to bear it? Is she, Maurice?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I am,&rsquo; she answered; and the calm firmness of her tone proved that
      she was a woman again. Her hand shook less than did that of her cousin, as
      silently and reverently he took it, and led her into another room on the
      same floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      There, in the subdued light, she saw her husband, seated on the bed,
      holding in his arms his son, who lay lifted up and supported upon his
      breast, with head resting on his shoulder, and eyes closed. There was no
      greeting, no sound save the long, heavily drawn, gasping breaths. Mr.
      Kendal raised his eyes to her; she silently knelt down and took the wasted
      hand that lay helplessly on the coverlet, but it moved feebly from her as
      though harassed by the touch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gilbert, dear boy,&rsquo; said his father, earnestly, &lsquo;she is come! Speak to
      him, Albinia.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She hardly knew her own voice as she said, &lsquo;Gilbert, Gibbie dear, here I
      am.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Those large brown eyes were shown for a few moments beneath the heavy
      lids, and met hers. The mouth, hitherto only gasping for air, endeavoured
      to form a word; the hand sought hers. She kissed him, and his eyes opened
      wide and brightened, while he said, &lsquo;I think it is pardon now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pardon indeed!&rsquo; said his father, with a greater look of relief than
      Albinia understood, &lsquo;you are resting in His Merits.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert&rsquo;s look brightened, and he said, &lsquo;I know it now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank God,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal.
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes closed, and Fred whispered to the father, &lsquo;Maurice is here too.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the light woke in the eye, with almost a smile, the look that always
      welcomed the little brother; and Albinia grieved to say, &lsquo;Not little
      Maurice, though he longed to come; it is my brother.&rsquo; But the air of
      eagerness did not pass away, and he seemed satisfied when Mr. Ferrars came
      in. It was as a priest, speaking words not his own; and Albinia and Fred
      knelt with him. At the close of each prayer or psalm, Gilbert signed
      imploringly for more, even like our mighty dying queen; and at each short
      pause, the distressed agonized expression would again contract the brow,
      though in the sound of the holy words all was peace. The Psalm of the Good
      Shepherd with the Rod and Staff in the Valley of the Shadow of Death,
      recurred so strongly to Maurice, that he repeated it like a cadence after
      each penitential supplication, every time bringing a look of peace to the
      countenance of the sufferer.
    </p>
    <p>
      They must have remained long thus, Fred had grown exhausted with kneeling
      and had been forced to sit on the floor, and Maurice&rsquo;s voice waxed low and
      hoarse; yet he durst not pause, though doubting whether Gilbert could
      follow the meaning. At length the eyes were again raised. With a start as
      of haste, Gilbert looked full at Albinia, and said, &lsquo;Thank you. Tell
      Maurice&mdash;&rsquo; He could not finish, and there was an agony for breath,
      then as his father raised him, he contrived to say, &lsquo;Father&mdash;mother&mdash;kiss
      me; it is forgiven!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Another look brought Fred to press his hand, and he smiled his thanks.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were a few more terrible minutes, from which they would fain have
      led away Albinia, but suddenly his brow grew smooth, his eyes were eagerly
      fixed as on something before him, and as if replying to a call, he said,
      &lsquo;Yes!&rsquo; with a start and a quiver of all his limbs, and then&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The first words were Mr. Kendal&rsquo;s. &lsquo;Edmund has come for him!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was to the rest as if the father had been in some manner conscious of
      the presence of the one twin-brother, and, were resigning the other to his
      charge, for he calmly kissed the forehead, closed the eyes, laid down the
      form, he had so long held in his arms, and after a few moments on his
      knees, with his face hidden, in his hands, he rose with composure, and
      said to his wife, &lsquo;I am glad you were in time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Had he given way, Albinia would have been strong, but there was no need to
      support to counteract the force of disappointment and grief, acting upon
      overwrought spirits, and a fatigued, exhausted frame. Were these
      half-conscious looks and broken words all she had come for, all she should
      ever have of Gilbert? This was the moment&rsquo;s predominant sensation; she was
      past thinking; and though she still controlled herself, she cast a wild,
      piteous eye on her husband, and as he lifted her up, she sank on his
      breast, not fainting, not sobbing, but utterly prostrated, and needing all
      his support as he led her out, and laid her on a couch in the next room,
      speaking softly as if hoping his voice would restore her. &lsquo;We had some
      faint hope of you; we knew you would wish it, so you see all is ready. But
      you have done too much, my dear: Maurice should not have let you travel so
      fast.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; said Albinia, catching her breath. &lsquo;Oh! not to have come
      sooner!&rsquo; and she gave way to a violent burst of tears, during which he
      fondled and soothed her till she suddenly said, &lsquo;I did not come here to
      behave in this way! I came to help you! Edmund, what shall I do?&rsquo; and she
      would have started up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only lie still, and let me take care of you,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;Nothing could be
      to me like your coming,&rsquo; and she was forced to believe his glistening eyes
      and voice of tenderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can you keep quiet a little while,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal, wistfully, &lsquo;while I
      go to speak to your brother? It was very good in him to come! Don&rsquo;t speak;
      I will come back directly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She did lie still, for she was too much spent to move, and the silence was
      good for her; for if the overwhelming sensation of grief would sweep over
      her, on the other hand, there was the remembrance of the look of peace,
      and the perception that her husband was not as yet so struck to the earth
      as she had feared. He was not long in returning, bringing some coffee for
      her and for himself, and speaking with the same dreamy serenity, though
      looking excessively pale. &lsquo;Your brother told me to give you this,&rsquo; he
      said. &lsquo;I am glad the colonel is under such care, for he is terribly
      distressed and not at all fit to bear it. I could not make him go to bed
      all last night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You were up all last night, and many nights before,&rsquo; said Albinia; &lsquo;and
      all alone! Oh! why was I not here to help!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fred was a great comfort,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal. &lsquo;I cannot describe my
      gratitude to him. And dearest&mdash;&rsquo; He paused, and added with
      hesitation, &lsquo;I do not now regret the having come out alone. After the
      first disappointment, I think that my boy and I learnt to know each other
      better. If he had left me nothing but the recollection that I had been too
      severe and unsympathizing to win his confidence, I hardly know how I could
      have borne it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He was able to talk to you, then?&rsquo; cried Albinia. &lsquo;That was what I always
      wished! Yes, it <i>was</i> right, so it came right. I had got between you
      as I ought not to have done, and it was well you should have him to
      yourself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not as you ought not,&rsquo; he fondly answered. &lsquo;You always were his better
      angel, and you came at last as a messenger of peace. There was relief and
      hope from the moment that he knew you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He told her what could scarcely have passed his lips save in those earlier
      hours of affliction. It had been a time of grievous mental distress.
      Neither natural temperament nor previous life had been such as to arm poor
      Gilbert to meet the King of Terrors; and as day by day he felt the cold
      grasp tightening on him, he had fluttered like a bird in the snare of the
      fowler, physically affrighted at the death-pang, shrinking from the lonely
      entrance into the unknown future, and despairing of the acceptableness of
      his own repentance. He believed that he had too often relapsed, and he
      could not take heart to grasp the hope of mercy and rest in the great
      atonement. The last Communion had been melancholy, the contrite spirit
      unable to lift itself up, and apparently only sunk the lower by the weight
      of love and gratitude, deepening the sense of how much had been
      disregarded. There had since been a few hopeful gleams, but dimmed by
      bodily suffering and terror; and doubly mournful had been the weary hours
      of the night and morning, while he lay gasping away his life upon his
      father&rsquo;s breast. Having at first taken the absence of his stepmother as a
      sign that she had not forgiven him, he had only laid aside this notion for
      a more morbid fancy that the deprivation was a token of wrath from above;
      and there could be little doubt that her final appearance was hailed as a
      seal of pardon not merely from her. Her brother, who had raised him up
      after his last fall, was likewise the person above all others to bring the
      message of mercy to speed him to the Unseen, where, as his look and
      gesture had persuaded his father, his brother, or some yet more blessed
      one, had received and welcomed the frail and trembling spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      That last farewell, that dawn of peace, so long prayed for, so ardently
      desired, had given Mr. Kendal such thankfulness and relief as sustained
      him, and enabled him to support his wife, who knew not how to meet her
      first home grief; whereas to him sorrow had long been a household guest
      more familiar than joy; and he was more at rest about his son than he had
      been for many a year. He could dwell on him together with Edmund, instead
      of connecting him with shame, grief, and pain; though how little could he
      have borne to think that thus it would end, when in the springtime of his
      manhood he had rejoiced over his beautiful twin boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew his son better than heretofore. After the first day&rsquo;s
      disappointment, Gilbert had found him all-sufficient, and had rested on
      his tenderness. All sternness had ceased on one side, all concealment on
      the other, and the sweetness of both characters had had full scope.
      Gilbert&rsquo;s ardent love of home had shown itself in every word, and his last
      exertion, had been to write a long letter to his little brother, which had
      been completed and despatched by a private hand a few days previously. He
      had desired that Maurice should have his sword, and mentioned the books
      which he wished his sisters to share, talking of Sophy as one whom he
      honoured much, and wished he had known better; but much pained by hearing
      nothing from Lucy, and lamenting his share in her union with Algernon. He
      had said something about his wish that the almshouses should be built, but
      his father had turned away the subject, knowing that in case of his dying
      intestate and unmarried, the property was settled on the sisters, and
      seeing little chance of any such work being carried out with the
      co-operation of Mr. Cavendish Dusautoy. Latterly he had spoken of
      Genevieve Durant; he knew better how unworthy of her he had been, and how
      harassing his pursuit must have appeared, but he could not help entreating
      that her pardon might be asked in his name, that she might hear that he
      had loved her to the last, and above all, that his father would never lose
      sight of her; and Mr. Kendal&rsquo;s promise to regard her as the next thing to
      his daughters had been requited with a look of the utmost gratitude and
      affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the substance of what Mr. Kendal told his wife as they sat
      together, unwitting of the lapse of time, and shrinking from any
      interruption that might mar their present peace and renew the sense of
      bereavement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ferrars was the first to knock at the door. He had been doing his
      utmost to spare both them and Fred, who needed all his care. These four
      months of mutual dependence had been even more endearing than the rescue
      of Fred&rsquo;s life on the battlefield; and he declared that Gilbert had done
      him more good than any one else. They had been so thrown together as to
      make the &lsquo;religious sentiment&rsquo; of the younger tell upon the warm though
      thoughtless heart of the elder. They had been most fondly attached; and in
      his present state, reduced by wounds and exhausted by watching, Fred was
      more overpowered than those more closely concerned. He could hardly speak
      collectedly when an officer of the garrison called to consult him with
      regard to a military funeral, and it was for this that Maurice was obliged
      to refer to the father. There were indeed none of his regiment in the
      island, but there was a universal desire in the garrison to do honour to
      the distinguished young officer, for whom great interest had been felt and
      the compliment brought a glow of exultation to Mr. Kendal&rsquo;s face, as he
      expressed his warm thanks, but desired that the decision might rest with
      Fred himself, as his son&rsquo;s lieutenant-colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maurice felt himself fully justified in his expedition when he found that
      all devolved on him, even writing to Sophy, and making the most necessary
      arrangements; for the colonel was incapable of exertion, Albinia was
      prostrated by the shock, and Mr. Kendal appeared to be lulled into a
      strange calm by the effects of the excessive bodily weariness consequent
      on the exhausting attendance of the last few days. They all depended upon
      Mr. Ferrars, and recognised his presence as an infinite comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the morning Albinia came forth like one who had been knocked down and
      shattered, weary and gentle, and with the tears ever welling into her
      eyes, above all when she endeavoured to write to Sophy; and she showed her
      ordinary earnestness only when she entreated to see her boy once more. Her
      husband took her to look on the countenance settled into the expression of
      unearthly peace, but she was not satisfied; it was not her own Gilbert,
      boyish, sensitive, dependent, and shrinking. The pale brow, the marked
      manly features, the lower ones concealed by the brown moustache, belonged
      to the hero who had dared the deadly ride and borne his friend through the
      storm of shot and shell; the noble, settled, steadfast face was the face
      of a stranger, and gave her a thrill of disappointment. She gloried in the
      later Gilbert, but the last she had seen of him whom she loved for his
      weakness, had been when she had not heeded his farewell.
    </p>
    <p>
      It made the pang the less when evening came and he was carried to his
      resting-place. They would have persuaded Frederick to spare himself, but
      as the only officer of the same corps, as well as for the sake of many
      closer ties, he would not hear of being absent, and made his cousin
      Maurice do his best to restore the smart soldierly air which he for the
      first time thought of regretting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert&rsquo;s horse had perished at Balaklava, but his cap, sword, and spurs,
      were laid on the coffin, and from her shaded window Albinia watched it
      borne between the files of soldiers with arms reversed; and the procession
      of officers whose bright array contrasted with the colonel&rsquo;s war-worn
      dress, ghastly cheek, and empty sleeve, tokens of the reality of war amid
      its pageantry, as all moved slowly away to the deep tones of the solemn
      Dead March, music well befitting the calm grandeur of the face she had
      seen, and leaving her heart throbbing with the deep exulting awe and
      pathos of a soldier&rsquo;s funeral. She knelt alone, and followed the burial
      service in the stillness of the room overlooking the broad expanse of blue
      sea and sky; and by-and-by, through the window came the sound of the
      volley fired over the grave, the farewell of the army to the soldier at
      rest, his battles ended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There was peace, and there was glory; but she could not divest herself of
      a sense of unreality. She could not feel as if it were really and truly
      Gilbert, and she were mourning for him. All was like a dream&mdash;that
      solemn military spectacle&mdash;the serene, grave sunshine on the
      fortress-harbour stretching its mailed arms into the sea&mdash;the roofs
      of the knightly old monastic city rising in steps from the bay crowded
      with white sails&mdash;and even those around her were different, her
      husband pale and still, as in a region above common life, and her cousin
      like another man, without his characteristic joyousness and insouciance.
      She could hardly induce herself, in her drowsy state, to believe that all
      was indeed veritable and tangible.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing to detain them at Malta, and Mr. Ferrars, who arranged
      everything, thought the calm of a sea-voyage would be better for them all
      than the bustle and fatigue of a land journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Kendal himself does not care about getting home,&rsquo; he said to Fred, who
      was afraid this was determined on his account. &lsquo;I fear many annoyances are
      in store for him. His son-in-law will not be pleasant to deal with about
      the property.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With an exclamation Fred started from the chairs on which he had been
      resting, and dived into his sabre-tasch which hung from the wall. &lsquo;I never
      liked to begin about it,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;but I ought to have given them this.
      It was done when he was so bad at Scutari. One night he worked himself
      into a fever lest he should not live till his birthday, and said a great
      deal about this Dusautoy making himself an annoyance, perhaps insisting on
      a sale and turning his father out. Nothing pacified him till, the very day
      he was of age, we got the vice-consul to draw up what he wanted, and
      witness it, and so did I and the doctor, and here it is. Afterwards he
      warned me to say nothing of it when Mr. Kendal came, for he said if the
      other fellow made a row, it would be better his father should be able to
      say he had known nothing of the matter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Does he make his father his heir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the whole of it. He said his sisters would see it was the only way
      to get things even, and I was to tell Albinia something about building
      cottages or almshouses. Ay, &ldquo;his father was to do what ought to have been
      done.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, there&rsquo;s the best deed of poor Gilbert&rsquo;s life!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; mumbled Fred, hall drolly, half gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ay, Kendal and Albinia will do more good with that property than you have
      thought of in all your life, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Their future and my past,&rsquo; laughed Fred, adding more gravely, &lsquo;Scamp as I
      am, there&rsquo;s more responsibility coming on me now, and I have gone through
      some preparation for it. If I can get out to Canada&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will not lessen your responsibilities,&rsquo; said Maurice, smiling, &lsquo;nor
      your competency to meet them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I <i>trust</i> not,&rsquo; said Fred.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ferrars read in his countenance far more than was implied by those
      words. The General, by treating him as a boy, had kept him one, and
      perhaps his levity had been prolonged by the rejection of his first love;
      but a really steady attachment had settled his character, and he had been
      undergoing much training through his own sufferings, Gilbert&rsquo;s illness,
      and the sense of the new position that awaited him as commanding officer;
      and for the first time Maurice, who had always been very fond of him, felt
      that he was talking to a high-principled and right-minded man instead of
      the family pet and laughing-stock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;that you cannot have heard often from Montreal
      since you have been in the East.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No. If my letters are anywhere, it is at the Family Office. I desired
      them to be forwarded thither from head-quarters, not expecting to be
      detained here. But,&rsquo; cried Fred with animation, &lsquo;what think you of the
      General actually writing to Mr. Kinnaird from Balaklava?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It would have been too bad if he had not.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I believe he did so solely to make me sleep, but it is the first time he
      has deigned to treat the affair as anything but a delusion, and he can&rsquo;t
      retract now. Since that, poor Gilbert has made a scrap or two of mine
      presentable, and there&rsquo;s all that I have been able to accomplish; but I
      hope it may have set her mind at rest.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shall I be secretary?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you, I think not. She would only worry herself about what is before
      me; and if the doctors let me off easy, I had rather report of myself in
      person.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes danced, and Maurice thought his unselfishness deserved a reward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My poor Gilbert&rsquo;s last secret,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal, as he laid before his
      wife the brief document by which his son had designated him as his sole
      heir and executor. &lsquo;A gift to you, and a trust to me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia looked up for explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;While he intrusts his sisters to my justice, he tacitly commends to me
      the works which you wished to see accomplished.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The almshouses! The improvements! Do you mean to undertake them?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It shall be my most sacred duty.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! that we could have planned it with him!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps I value this the more from the certainty that it is spontaneous,&rsquo; 
      said Mr. Kendal. &lsquo;It showed great consideration and forethought, that he
      said nothing of his intention to me. Had he mentioned it, I should have
      thought it right to suggest his leaving his sisters their share; and yet,
      as we are situated with young Dusautoy, it would have been awkward to have
      interfered. He did well and wisely to be silent.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t expect Algernon to be discontented. Impossible, at such a time,
      and so well off as he is!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish it may be impossible.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you mean, to do?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As far as I can see at present, I shall do this. I fear neither the mode
      of acquisition nor the management of that property was such as to bring a
      blessing, and I believe my poor boy has made it over to me in order to
      free his sisters from the necessity of winking at oppression and iniquity.
      Had it gone to them, matters must have been let alone till Sophia came of
      age, and even then, all improvements must have depended on Algernon&rsquo;s
      consent. The land and houses we will keep, and sufficient ready money for
      the building and repairs; and to this, Sophia, at least, will gladly
      agree. The rest&mdash;something under twenty thousand, if I remember
      correctly&mdash;is the girls&rsquo; right. I will settle Lucy&rsquo;s share on her so
      as to be out of her husband&rsquo;s power, and Sophia shall have hers when she
      comes of age.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am sure that will take from Algernon all power of grumbling, though I
      cannot believe that even he could complain.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You approve, then?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How can you ask? It is the first thing that has seemed like happiness, if
      it did not make one long for him to talk it over!&rsquo; The wound was still
      very recent, and her spirits very tender, and the more she felt the
      blessing of the association with Gilbert in the work of love, the more she
      wept, though not altogether in sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mortified at having come so much overworked and weakened, as to occasion
      only trouble and anxiety, she yielded resignedly when forbidden to wear
      out strength and spirits by a visit to the burial-ground before her
      embarkation. She must content herself with Maurice&rsquo;s description of the
      locality, and carry away in her eye only the general picture of the
      sapphire ocean and white rock fortress of the holy warriors vowed to
      tenderness and heroism, as the last resting-place of her cherished
      Gilbert, when &lsquo;out of weakness he had been made strong&rsquo; in penitence and
      love.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Had Sophia&rsquo;s wishes been consulted, she would have preferred nursing her
      sorrows at home; but no choice had been left, and at the vicarage the
      fatherly kindness of Mr. Dusautoy, and the considerate let-alone system of
      his wife, kept her at ease and not far from cheerful, albeit neither the
      simplicity of the one nor the keenness of the other was calculated to draw
      her into unreserve: comfort was in the children.
    </p>
    <p>
      The children clung to her as if she made their home, little Albinia
      preferring her even to Uncle John, as he had insisted on being called ever
      since Lucy had become his niece, and Maurice invoking caresses, the
      bestowal of which was his mother&rsquo;s rare privilege. The boy was dull and
      listless, and though riot and mirth could be only too easily excited, his
      wildest shouts and most frantic gesticulations were like efforts to throw
      off a load at his heart. Time hung heavy on his hands, and he would lie
      rolling and kicking drearily on the floor, watching with some envy his
      little sister as she spelt her way prosperously through &lsquo;Little Charles,&rsquo; 
      or daintily and distinctly repeated her hymns. &lsquo;Nothing to do&rsquo; was the
      burthen of his song, and with masculine perverseness he disdained every
      occupation suggested to him. Sophy might boast of his obedience and
      quiescence, but Mrs. Dusautoy pitied all parties, and wondered when he
      would be disposed of at school.
    </p>
    <p>
      Permission to open letters had been left with Sophy, who with silent
      resignation followed the details of poor Gilbert&rsquo;s rapid decay. At last
      came the parcel by the private hand, containing a small packet for each of
      the family. Sophy received a silver Maltese Cross, and little Albinia a
      perfumy rose-leaf bracelet. There was a Russian grape-shot for Maurice,
      and with it a letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      With childish secrecy, he refused to let any one look at so much as the
      envelope, and ran away with it, shouting &lsquo;It&rsquo;s mine.&rsquo; Sophy was grieved
      that it should be treated like a toy, and fearing that, while playing at
      importance, he would lose or destroy it, without coming to a knowledge of
      the contents, she durst not betray her solicitude, lest she should give a
      stimulus to his wilfulness and precipitate its fate. However, when he had
      galloped about enough, he called imperatively, &lsquo;Sophy;&rsquo; and she found him
      lying on his back on the grass, the black cat an unwilling prisoner on his
      chest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You may read it to Smut and me,&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      It bore date the day after his father&rsquo;s arrival, but it had evidently been
      continued at many different times; and as the handwriting became more
      feeble, the style grew more earnest, so that, but for her hoarse,
      indifferent voice, Sophy could hardly have accomplished the reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear Maurice,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Many, many thanks to you and dear little Awkey for your present. I have
      set it up like a picture, and much do I like to look at it, and guess who
      chose the colours and who are the hunters. I am sure the fat man in the
      red coat is the admiral. It makes the place seem like home to see what
      tells so plainly of you and baby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Kiss my little Awk for me, and thank her for wanting to send me Miss
      Jenny, dear little maid; I like to think of it. You will not let her quite
      forget me. You must show her my name if it is put up in church, like
      Edmund&rsquo;s and all the little ones&rsquo;; and you will sometimes tell her about
      dear old Ned on a Sunday evening when you are both very good.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think you know that you and she will never again run out into the hall
      to pull Gibbie almost down between you. Perhaps by the time you read this,
      you will be the only son, with all the comfort and hope of the house
      resting upon you. My poor Maurice, I know what it is to be told so, and
      only to feel that one has no brother; but at least it cannot be to you as
      it was with me, when it was as if half myself were gone, and all my
      stronger, better, braver self.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My father has been reading to me the Rich Man and Lazarus. Maurice, when
      you read of him and the five brethren, think of me, and how I pray that I
      may not have left seeds of temptation for you. In the time of my
      loneliness, Tritton was good-natured, but I ought to have avoided him; and
      that to which he introduced me has been the bane of my life. Nothing gives
      me such anguish as to think I have made you acquainted with that set. Keep
      out of their way! Never go near those pigeon-shootings and donkey-races;
      they seem good fun, but it is disobedience to go, and the things that
      happen there are like the stings of venomous creatures; the poison was
      left to fester even when your mother seemed to have cured me. Neither now
      nor when you are older resort to such things or such people. Next time you
      meet Tritton and Shaw tell them I desired to be remembered to them; after
      that have nothing to do with them; touch your hat and pass on. They meant
      it in good nature, and thought no harm, but they were my worst enemies;
      they led me astray, and taught me deception as a matter of course. Oh!
      Maurice, never think it manly to have the smallest reserve with your
      parents. I would give worlds to have sooner known that truth would have
      been freedom and rest. Thank Heaven, your faults are not my faults. If you
      go wrong, it will be with a high hand, but you would wring hearts that can
      ill bear further grief and disappointment. Oh! that I were more worthy to
      pray that you may use your strength and spirit the right way; then you
      will be gladness to our father and mother, and when you lie down to die,
      you will be happier than I am.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I want to tell you more, but it hurts me to write long. If I could only
      see you&mdash;not only in my dreams. I wake, and my heart sickens with
      longing for a sight of my brave boy&rsquo;s merry face, till I almost feel as if
      it would make me well; but it is a blessing past hope to have my father
      with me, and know him as I have never done before. Give little Albinia
      these beads, with my love, and be a better brother to her than I was to
      poor Lucy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good-by, Maurice. No one can tell what you have been to me since your
      mother put you into my arms, and I felt I had a brother again. God bless
      you and cancel all evil you may have caught from me. Papa will give you my
      sword. Perhaps you will wear it one day, and under my colonel. I have
      never been so happy as in the time it was mine. When you look at it,
      always say this to yourself: &ldquo;Fear God, and fear nothing else.&rdquo; O that I
      had done so!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let your dear, dear mother be happy in you: it will be the only way to
      make her forgive me in her heart. Good-by, my own dear, brave boy.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                                 &lsquo;Your most affectionate brother,
                                                 &lsquo;G. KENDAL.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I say, Smut,&rsquo; quoth Maurice, &lsquo;I think you and our Tabby would make two
      famous horses for Awkey&rsquo;s little cart. I shall take you home and harness
      you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy sat breathless at his indifference. &lsquo;You mustn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; she said in hasty
      anger; &lsquo;Smut is not yours.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, Jack said that our Tabby had two kittens up in the loft; I think
      they&rsquo;ll make better ponies. I shall go and try them!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t plague the kittens.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll not plague them; I&rsquo;ll only make ponies of them. Give me the letter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, not to play with the cats. I thought you would have cared about such
      a letter!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have no right to keep it! It is mine; give it me!&rsquo; cried Maurice,
      passionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Promise to take real care of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He only tore it from her, and was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m a fool to expect anything from such a child,&rsquo; she thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      At two o&rsquo;clock the Vicar hurried into the bank. &lsquo;Good morning, Mr.
      Goldsmith, I beg your pardon; I wanted to ask if Mr. O&rsquo;More has seen
      little Maurice Kendal.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not since yesterday&mdash;what&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The child is not come in to dinner. He is nowhere at home or at Willow
      Lawn.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ha!&rsquo; cried Ulick. &lsquo;Can he be gone to see his pony at Hobbs&rsquo;s!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, it has been sent to Fairmead. Then you have no notion where the child
      can be? Sophy is nearly distracted. She saw him last about ten o&rsquo;clock,
      bent on harnessing some kittens, but he&rsquo;s not in the hay-loft!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He may be gone to the toy-shop after the harness. Or has anyone looked in
      the church-tower&mdash;he was longing to go up it, and if the door were
      open&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The very thing!&rsquo; cried the Vicar. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go this moment.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Or there&rsquo;s old Peter, the sailor,&rsquo; called Ulick; &lsquo;if he wanted any tackle
      fitted, he might go to him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You had better go yourself, More,&rsquo; said Mr. Goldsmith. &lsquo;One would not
      wish to keep poor Miss Kendal in suspense, though I dare say the boy is
      safe enough.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Goldsmith was thanked, and Ulick hurried out, Hyder Ali leaping up in
      amazement at his master being loose at that time of day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everybody had thought the child was with somebody else till dinner-time,
      and the state of the vicarage was one of dire alarm and self-reproach.
      Sophy was seeking and calling in every possible place, and had just
      brought herself to own the message of remembrance in Gilbert&rsquo;s letter,
      thinking it possible Maurice might have gone to deliver it at Robbles
      Leigh; and Mr. Hope had undertaken to go thither in quest of him. Ulick
      and Mr. Dusautoy, equally disappointed by the tower and the sailor, went
      again to Willow Lawn to interrogate the servants. The gardener&rsquo;s boy had
      heard Maurice scolding and the cat squalling, and the cook had heard his
      step in the house. They hurried into his little room&mdash;he was not
      there, but the drawers had been disturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He may be gone to Fairmead!&rsquo; cried the Vicar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How?&rsquo; said Ulick. &lsquo;Ha! Hyder, sir!&rsquo; holding up a little shoe. &lsquo;Seek!
      That&rsquo;s my fine doggie&mdash;they only call you a mongrel because you have
      all the canine virtues united. See what you can do as sleuth hound. Ha!
      We&rsquo;ll nose him out for you in no time, Mr. Dusautoy!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      After sniffing round the drawers, the yellow tripod made an ungainly
      descent of the stairs, his nose down all the way, then across the hall and
      out at the gate; but when, after poking about, the animal set off on the
      turnpike-road, the Vicar demurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stay; the poor dog only wants to get you out for a walk. He is making for
      the Hadminster road.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And why wouldn&rsquo;t he, if the child is nowhere in Bayford?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t answer it to his mother wasting time in this way. You may do as
      you like. I shall go to the training-stables, where he has once been, if
      not on to Fairmead. I can&rsquo;t see Sophy till he is found!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall abide by my little Orangeman,&rsquo; said Ulick; and they parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hyder Ali pursued his way in the March dust, while Ulick eagerly scanned
      for the traces of a child&rsquo;s foot. Four miles did the dog go on, evidently
      following a scent, but Ulick&rsquo;s mind misgave him as Hadminster church-tower
      rose before him, and the dog took the ascent to the station.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ulick made his way in as a train stood panting before the platform. He had
      a glimpse of a square face and curly hair at the window of a second-class
      carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Maurice, come back!&rsquo; he cried. &lsquo;Here, guard! this little boy must come
      back!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Go on!&rsquo; shouted Maurice. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got my ticket. &lsquo;No one can stop me. I&rsquo;m
      going to Malta!&rsquo; and he tried to get to the other side of a stout
      traveller, who defended his legs from him, and said, &lsquo;Ha! Running away
      from school, young master! Here&rsquo;s your usher.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I&rsquo;m not running away! I&rsquo;m not at school! I&rsquo;m Maurice Kendal! I&rsquo;m
      going to my brother at Malta!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is the son of Mr. Kendal of Bayford,&rsquo; said Ulick to the
      station-master,&rsquo; his parents are from home, and there will be dreadful
      distress if he goes in this way. Maurice, your sister has troubles enough
      already.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve my ticket, and can&rsquo;t be stopped.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But even as he spoke, the stout traveller picked him up by the collar, and
      dropped him like a puppy dog into Ulick&rsquo;s arms, just as the train was
      getting into motion; and a head protruded from every window to see the
      truant, who was pommelling Ulick in a violent fury, and roaring, &lsquo;Let me
      go; I will go to Gilbert!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Behave like a man,&rsquo; said Ulick; &lsquo;don&rsquo;t disgrace yourself in that way.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy coloured, and choking with passion and disappointment, and
      straining against Ulick&rsquo;s hold of his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed, sir,&rsquo; said the station-master, &lsquo;if we had recognised the young
      gentleman, we would have made more inquiries, but he asked so readily for
      his ticket, not seeming at a loss, and we have so many young travellers,
      that we thought of nothing amiss. Will you have a fly, sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not going home,&rsquo; said the boy, undaunted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You must submit, Maurice. You do not wish to make poor Sophy miserable.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I must go to Malta,&rsquo; the boy persisted. &lsquo;Gilbert says it would make him
      well to see me. I know my way; I saw it in the map, and I&rsquo;ve a roll, and
      the end of a cold tongue, and a clean shirt, and my own sovereign, and
      four shillings, and a half-crown, and a half-penny in my pocket; and I&rsquo;m
      going!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But, Maurice, this gentleman will tell you that your whole sovereign
      would not carry you a quarter of the way to Malta.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The station-master gave so formidable a description of the impossibilities
      of the route, that the hardy little fellow&rsquo;s look of decision relaxed into
      dejection, his muscles lost their tension, and he struggled hard with his
      tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      He followed Ulick to the carriage, and hid his face in a corner, while
      orders were given to stop at the post-office in case there were fresh
      letters. There was one for Miss Kendal, in Mr. Ferrars&rsquo; writing, and with
      black borders. Ulick felt too surely what it must be, and hardly could
      bear to address Maurice, who had shrunk from him with some remains of
      passion, but hearing suppressed sobs, he put his hand on him and said, &lsquo;My
      poor little man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Get away,&rsquo; said Maurice, shaking him off. &lsquo;Why did you come and bother?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I came because it would have almost killed your sister and mother for you
      to be lost. If you had seen Sophy&rsquo;s face, Maurice!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t care. Now I shall never see Gilbert again, and he did want me
      so!&rsquo; Maurice hid his face, and his frame shook with sobs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Ulick, &lsquo;every one knew he wanted you; but if it had been
      possible for you to go, your mamma would have taken you. If your uncle had
      to take care of her how could you go alone?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;d have got there somehow,&rsquo; cried Maurice. &lsquo;I&rsquo;d have seen and heard
      Gilbert. He&rsquo;s written me a letter to say he wants to see me, and I can&rsquo;t
      even make that out!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Has not your sister read it to you!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hate Sophy&rsquo;s reading!&rsquo; cried Maurice. &lsquo;It makes it all grumpy, like
      her. Take it, Ulick&mdash;you read it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      That rich, sensitive, modulated voice brought out the meaning of the
      letter, though there were places where Ulick had nearly broken down; and
      Maurice pressed against him with the large tears in his eyes, and was some
      minutes without speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He does not think of your coming; he does not expect you, dear boy,&rsquo; said
      Ulick. &lsquo;It is a precious letter to have. I hope you will keep it and read
      it often, and heed it too.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t read it,&rsquo; said Maurice, ruefully. &lsquo;If I could, I shouldn&rsquo;t mind.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You soon will. You see how he tells you you are to be a comfort; and if
      you are a good boy, you&rsquo;ll quickly leave the dunce behind.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said Maurice. &lsquo;Mamma said I should not do a bit of a lesson
      with Sophy, or I should tease her heart out. Would it come quite out?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I think you&rsquo;ve gone hard to try to-day,&rsquo; said Ulick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mamma said my being able to read would be a comfort, and papa says he
      never saw such an ignorant boy! so what&rsquo;s the use of minding Gilbert&rsquo;s
      letter? It wont let me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What wont let you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fun!&rsquo; said Maurice, with a sob.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is a rogue!&rsquo; cried Ulick, vehemently; &lsquo;but a stout heart and good will
      can get him under yet. Think of what your brother says of making your
      father and mother happy!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I could do something to please them very, very much! Oh! if I could
      but learn to read all at once.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You can read&mdash;anybody can read!&rsquo; said Ulick, pulling a book out of
      his pocket. &lsquo;There! try.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was some laughing over this; and then Maurice leant out of window,
      and grew sleepy. They had descended into the wide basin of alluvial land
      through which the Baye dawdled its meandering course, and were just about
      to cross the first bridge about two miles from Bayford, when Maurice
      shouted, &lsquo;There&rsquo;s Sophy!&mdash;how funny.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a tall figure, in deep mourning, slowly moving along the
      towing-path, intently gazing into the river; but so strange was it to see
      Sophy so far from home, that Ulick paused a moment ere calling to the
      driver to stop.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he hastily wrenched open the door, she raised up her face, and he was
      shocked. She looked as if she had lived years of sorrow, and even Maurice
      was struck with consternation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sophy! Sophy!&rsquo; he cried, hanging round her. &lsquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have gone without
      telling you, if I had thought you would mind it. Speak to me, Sophy!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She could say nothing save a hoarse &lsquo;Where?&rsquo; as with both arms she pressed
      him as if she could never let him go again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In the train&mdash;intending to go to Malta,&rsquo; said Ulick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t know I could not; I didn&rsquo;t mean to vex you, Sophy,&rsquo; continued
      the child. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m come home now, and I wont try again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! Maurice, what would have become of you?&rsquo; She held out her hand to
      Ulick, the first time for months.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And we&rsquo;ve got a letter for you, proceeded Maurice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ulick would fain have withheld it, but he had not the choice. She caught
      at it, still holding Maurice fast, and ere he could propose her opening it
      in the carriage while he walked home she had torn it open, and the same
      moment she had sunk down, seated on the path, with an arm round her
      brother. &lsquo;Oh! Maurice, it is well you are here! You would not have found
      them&mdash;it is over!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She had found one brother to lose the other; but the relief of Maurice&rsquo;s
      safety had so softened the blow, that her tears gushed forth freely.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sense of Ulick&rsquo;s presence restrained her, but raising her head, she
      missed him, and felt lonely, desolate, deserted, almost fainting, and in a
      strange place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is he dead?&rsquo; said Maurice, in a solemn low voice, and she wept
      helplessly, while the little fellow stood sustaining her weight like a
      small pillar, perplexed and dismayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you poorly, Sophy? What shall I do?&rsquo; said he, as she almost fell
      back, but a stronger arm held her up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lean on me, dear Sophy,&rsquo; said Ulick, who had returned, bringing some
      water from a small house near at hand, and supported her and soothed her
      like a brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mists cleared away, the sense of desertion was gone, and she rose, but
      could not stand without his arm, and he almost lifted her into the
      carriage, where her appealing eye and helpless gesture made him follow
      her, and take Maurice on his knee. No one spoke; Maurice nestled close to
      his friend; awe-struck but weighed down by weariness and excitement. The
      blow had in reality been given when he was forced to relinquish the hope
      of seeing his brother again, and the actual certainty of his death fell
      with less comparative force. Perhaps he did not enter into the fact enough
      to ask for particulars. After a short space Sophy recovered herself enough
      to take out the letter, and read it over with greater comprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They were come!&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In time. I am glad.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In time to bring him peace, my uncle says! He knew mamma. I could never
      have borne it if I had deprived him of her!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nor I,&rsquo; said Ulick, from his heart. &lsquo;Did one but know the upshot of one&rsquo;s
      idle follies!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy looked towards Maurice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Asleep!&rsquo; said Ulick. &lsquo;No wonder. He has walked four miles! He has a heart
      that might have been born in Ireland;&rsquo; and as he looked at the fair young
      face softened and sweetened by sleep, &lsquo;What an infant it is to have even
      fancied such an undertaking!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor child!&rsquo; sighed Sophy. &lsquo;He will never be the same!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nay, grief at that age does not check the spirits for life.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have never known,&rsquo; said Sophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No; our number has never yet been broken; but for this little man, I
      trust that the sense of duty may be deepened, and with it his love to you
      all; and surely that is not what will quench the blithe temper.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;May it be so!&rsquo; said Sophy. &lsquo;He may have enough of his mother in him to be
      happy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I must think that the recollection of so loving a brother, and his pride
      in him for a hero, may make the stream flow more deeply, but not more
      darkly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There never was a cloud between them,&rsquo; said Sophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Clouds are all past and gone now between those who can with him &ldquo;take
      part in that thanksgiving lay,&rdquo;&rsquo; answered Ulick, kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Sophy. &lsquo;My uncle says it was peace at last! Oh! if humbleness
      and penitence could win it, one might be sure it would be his.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;True,&rsquo; said Ulick. &lsquo;It was a beautiful thing to find the loving sweetness
      and kindness refined into self-devotion and patience, and growing into
      something brighter and purer as it came near the last. It will be a
      precious recollection.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To those who have no self-reproach,&rsquo; sighed Sophy; and after a pause she
      abruptly resumed, &lsquo;You once blamed me for being hard with him. Nothing was
      more true.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Impossible&mdash;when could I have presumed?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When? You remember. After Oxford.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! you should not have let what I said dwell with you. I was a very raw
      Irishman then, and thought it barbarity to look cold on a little
      indiscretion, but I have learnt to think differently,&rsquo; and he sighed. &lsquo;The
      severity that leads to repentance is truer affection than is shown by
      making light of foolishness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If it had been affection and not wounded pride.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The dross has been refined away, if there were any,&rsquo; said Ulick. &lsquo;You
      will be able to love him better now than ever you did in life.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His comprehension met her half way, and gave her more relief and soothing
      than anything she had experienced for months. There was that response and
      intercommunion of spirit for which her nature had yearned the more because
      of the inability to express the craving; the very turn of the dark blue
      eyes, and the inflexions of the voice, did not merely convey pity, but an
      entering into the very core of her sorrow, namely, that she had never
      loved her brother enough, nor forgiven him for not being his fellow-twin.
      Whatever he said tended to reveal to her that there had been more justice,
      rectitude, sisterly feeling, and wholesome training than she had given
      herself credit for, and, above all, that Gilbert had loved her all the
      time. She was induced to dwell on the exalting and touching circumstances
      of his last redeeming year, and her tears streamed calmly and softly, not
      with the harshness that had hitherto marred her grief. Neither could have
      believed that there had been so long and marked a separation in feeling,
      or that Ulick O&rsquo;More had not always been one with the Kendal family. It
      was all too soon that the conversation ended, and Maurice wakened suddenly
      at the vicarage wicket. Mrs. Dusautoy herself came to meet them as the
      little boy was lifted out. She had never been seen on her own feet so far
      from the house before! But no one ever knew the terror she had suffered,
      when of all her three charges not one was safe but the little Albinia,
      whose &lsquo;poor Maurice&rsquo; and &lsquo;all gone&rsquo; were as trying as her alternations of
      merriment. The vicar, the curate, the parish clerk, the servants of the
      two establishments, and four policemen, were all gone different ways; and
      poor Mrs. Dusautoy&rsquo;s day had been spent in hearing the results of their
      fruitless researches, or in worse presages, in which, as it now appeared,
      the river had played its part.
    </p>
    <p>
      She kissed Maurice, and he did not rebel! She kissed Sophy, and could have
      shaken off Ulick&rsquo;s hand, but he only waited to hold up Hyder Ali as the
      real finder, before he ran off to desire the school-bell to be rung&mdash;the
      signal for announcing a discovery. It was well that Maurice was too much
      stunned and fatigued to be sensible what a commotion he had excited, or he
      might have thought it good fun.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tidings from Malta came in almost as something secondary. The case had
      been too hopeless for anything else to be looked for, and when Mrs.
      Dusautoy consigned her charge to a couch, with entreaties to her not to
      move, there was calm tenderness in Sophy&rsquo;s voice as she told what needed
      to be told, and did not shrink from sympathy. She was grateful and gentle,
      and lay all the rest of the day, sad and physically worn out, but quietly
      mournful, and no longer dwelling on the painful side of past transactions,
      her remorse had given way to resigned acquiescence, and desolation to a
      sense that there was one who understood her. The sweet tones, and, above
      all, those two words, &lsquo;<i>dear</i> Sophy,&rsquo; would come chiming back from
      some involuntary echo, and the turbid depths were at peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mr. Dusautoy came to her side, and held out his hand, his honest eyes
      brimming over, there was no repulsion in her manner of saying
      affectionately, &lsquo;You have had a great deal of trouble for my naughty
      little brother.&rsquo; So different was her whole tone, that her kind friends
      thought how much better for some minds was any certainty than suspense.
      She bethought herself of sending to the Drurys, and showed rather
      gratification than her ordinary impatience at the manifold reports of the
      general sympathy, and of Bayford&rsquo;s grief for its hero. The poison was gone
      from her mind.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Family Office had been asked to receive the whole party on their
      return. Mr. Kendal had business in London, and could not bear to part with
      the colonel till he had seen him safely lodged, and heard the surgeon&rsquo;s
      opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ferrars was laying himself out to guard his brother-in-law from being
      oppressed by the sympathetic welcome of the good aunts; but though the
      good ladies never failed in kindness, all the excess was directed into a
      different channel; Albinia herself was but secondary to the wounded hero,
      for whom alone they had eyes and ears. They would hardly let him stand
      erect for a moment; easy-chairs and couches were offered, soup and wine,
      biscuits and coffee were suggested, and questions were crowded on him,
      while he, poor fellow, wistfully gazed at the oft-directed pile of foreign
      letters on the side-table, and in pure desperation became too fatigued to
      go down to luncheon.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the others returned, he was standing on the rug, curling his
      moustaches. There was a glow of colour on his hollow cheek, and his eyes
      danced; he put out his hand, and catching Albinia&rsquo;s with boyish
      playfulness, he squeezed it triumphantly, with the words, &lsquo;Albinia, she&rsquo;s
      a brick!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They went their several ways, Fred to rest, Maurice to make an appointment
      for him with the doctor, and Albinia to Genevieve, whom Mr. Kendal
      regarded like his son&rsquo;s widow, forgetting that the attachment had been
      neither sanctioned nor returned. He could not rest without seeing her, and
      delivering that last message, but he was glad to have the way prepared by
      his wife, and proposed to call for her when his law business should be
      over.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia sent in her card, and asked whether Miss Durant were at liberty.
      Genevieve came hurrying to her with outstretched hands: &lsquo;Dear Mrs. Kendal,
      this is kind!&rsquo; and led her to the back drawing-room, where they were with
      one impulse enfolded in each other&rsquo;s tearful embrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! madame, how much you have suffered!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You know all?&rsquo; said Albinia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O no, very little. My aunt knows little of Bayford now, and her sight is
      too weak for much writing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Genevieve pushed back her hair; she looked ill and heavy-eyed, with the
      extinguished air that sorrow gave her. Gilbert had distressed, perplexed
      her, and driven her from home, but what could be remembered, save the warm
      affection he had lavished on her, and the pain she had inflicted?
      Uneasiness and sorrow, necessarily unavowed, had preyed on the poor girl
      for weeks in secret; and even now she hardly presumed to give way, relief,
      almost luxury, as it was to be pressed in those kind arms, and suffered to
      weep freely for the champion of her younger days. When she had heard how
      he had thought of her to the last, her emotion grew less controllable; and
      Albinia was touched by the idea that there had all along been a stifled
      preference. Embellished as Gilbert now was, she could not but wish to
      believe that his affection had not been wasted; and his constancy might
      well be touching in one of the heroes of the six hundred. At least,
      Genevieve had a most earnest and loving appetite for every detail, and
      though the afternoon was nearly gone, neither felt as if half an hour had
      passed when admittance was asked for Mr. Kendal.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a trying moment, but Genevieve was too simple, genuine, and
      grateful to pause in selfish embarrassment. Had she toyed with Gilbert&rsquo;s
      affection, she could not have met his father with such maidenly modesty,
      and sweet sympathy and respect in her blushing cheek and downcast, tearful
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took her hand, speaking in the kindest tone of his mellow voice: &lsquo;My
      dear, Mrs. Kendal has told you what brings us here, and how much we feel
      for and with you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So kind in you,&rsquo; said Genevieve, faltering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor child, she has suffered grievously for want of fuller tidings,&rsquo; said
      Albinia; &lsquo;she has been keeping her sorrow pent up all this time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She has acted, as she has done throughout, most consistently,&rsquo; said Mr.
      Kendal. &lsquo;My dear, though it was inexpedient to show my sentiments, I
      always respected my son for having placed his affections so worthily, and
      though circumstances were unfortunately adverse, I cannot thank you enough
      for your course of action and the influence you exercised.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never did,&rsquo; murmured Genevieve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not perhaps consciously; but unswerving rectitude of conduct is one of
      the strongest earthly influences. He was sensible of it. He bade me tell
      you that whenever higher and better thoughts came to him, you were
      connected with them; and when to his surprise, poor boy, he found that he
      was thought to have distinguished himself, his first thought was that it
      might be a step to your esteem. He desired me to thank you for all that
      you have been to him, to entreat you to pardon the annoyance of which he
      was the occasion, and to beg you to wear this for his sake, if you could
      think of his presumption with forgiveness and toleration. Those were his
      words; but I trust you do not retain displeasure, for though, perhaps,
      foolishly and obtrusively expressed, it was sincere and lasting
      affection.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, sir!&rsquo; exclaimed Genevieve, &lsquo;do not speak thus! What can I feel save
      that it will be my tenderest and deepest pride to have been so regarded.
      Oh! that I could thank him! but,&rsquo; clasping her hands together, &lsquo;I cannot
      even thank you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The best way to gratify us,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;will be always to remember that
      you have a home at Willow Lawn, and a daughter&rsquo;s place in our hearts.
      Think of me like a father, Genevieve;&rsquo; and he kissed her drooping
      forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! Mr. Kendal, this is goodness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned to Albinia to suggest, &lsquo;It must be intolerable to be here at
      present. Speak to Mrs. Rainsforth, let us take her home, if it be but for
      a week.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving him to make the proposition to Genevieve, Albinia gained
      admittance to the other drawing-room, which she found all over little
      children, and their mother looking unequal to dispensing with their
      deputy. She said she had feared Miss Durant was looking ill, and had
      something weighing on her spirits, though she was always so cheerful and
      helpful, but baby had not been well, and Mr. Rainsforth was not at all
      strong, and her views had evidently taken no wider range.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia began to think her proposal cruel, and prefaced it by a few words
      on the state of the case. The little bit of romance touched the kind
      heart. Mrs. Rainsforth was shocked to think of the grief the governess
      must have suffered in secret while aiding to bear her burdens, and was
      resolved on letting her have this respite, going eagerly to assure her
      that she could well be spared; baby was better, and papa was better, and
      the children would be good.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Genevieve knew too well how necessary she was, and had been telling
      Mr. Kendal of the poor little mother&rsquo;s anxieties with her many delicate
      children, and her husband&rsquo;s failing health. She could not leave them with
      a safe conscience; and she would not show how she longed after quiet, the
      country, and her aunt. She stood firm, and Albinia could not say that she
      was not right. Mrs. Rainsforth was distressed, though much relieved, and
      was only pacified by the engagement that Miss Durant should, when it was
      practicable, spend a long holiday with her friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At home!&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal, and the responsive look of mournful gratitude
      from beneath the black dewy eyelashes dispelled all marvel at his son&rsquo;s
      enduring attachment.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was wonderfully patient when Mrs. Rainsforth could not be content
      without Mrs. Kendal&rsquo;s maternal and medical opinion of the baby, on the
      road to and from the nursery consulting her on all the Mediterranean
      climates, and telling her what each doctor had said of Mr. Rainsforth&rsquo;s
      lungs, in the course of which Miss Durant and her romance were put as
      entirely out of the little lady&rsquo;s mind as if she had never existed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day the Kendals set their faces homewards, leaving Maurice till
      the surgeon&rsquo;s work should be done, and Fred, as the aunts fondly hoped, to
      be their nursling.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, behold! Sunday and Monday Colonel Fred spent in bed, smiling
      incessantly; Tuesday and Wednesday on the sofa; Thursday in going about
      London; Friday he was off to Liverpool; Saturday had sailed for Canada.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia was coming nearer to the home that was pulling her by the
      heart-strings. Hadminster was past, and she had heard the welcome wards,
      &lsquo;All well,&rsquo; from the servant who brought the carriage; but how much more
      there was to know than Sophy&rsquo;s detailed letters could convey&mdash;Sophy,
      whose sincerity, though one of the most trustworthy things in the world,
      was never quite to be relied on as to her own health or Maurice&rsquo;s conduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the gate there was a little chestnut curled being in a short black
      frock, struggling to pull the heavy gate open with her plump arms, and
      standing for one moment with her back to it, screaming &lsquo;Mamma! Papa!&rsquo; then
      jumping and clapping her hands in ecstasy and oblivion that the swing of
      the gate might demolish her small person between it and the horse. But
      there was no time for fright. Sophy caught her and secured the gate
      together; and the first glimpse assured Albinia that the hard gloom was
      absent. And there was Maurice, leaning against the iron rail of the hall
      steps; but he hardly moved, and his face was so strangely white and set,
      that Albinia caught him in her arms, crying, &lsquo;Are you well, my boy? Sophy,
      is he well?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quite well,&rsquo; said Sophy; but the boy had wriggled himself loose, stood
      but for an instant to receive his father&rsquo;s kiss, and had hold of the
      sword. The long cavalry sabre was almost as tall as himself, and he stood
      with both arms clasped round it; but no sooner did he feel their eyes upon
      him, than he turned about and ran upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not gracious, but they excused it; they had their little Albinia
      comfortably and childishly happy, as yet without those troublesome Kendal
      feelings that always demonstrated themselves in some perverse manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Sophy stood among them&mdash;that brighter, better Sophy who had so
      long been obscured, happy to have them at home; talking and asking
      questions eagerly about the journey, and describing the kindness of the
      Dusautoys and the goodness of the children.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you heard from Lucy?&rsquo; asked Mr. Kendal, as Albinia went in pursuit
      of her little boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes&mdash;poor Lucy?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is there no letter from him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not for you, papa.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What? Did he write to his uncle?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, papa&mdash;he wrote to me and to Mr. Pettilove. Cannot he be stopped,
      papa? Can he do any harm? Mr. Dusautoy and Mr. Pettilove think he can.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You mean that he wishes to question the will? You may be quite secure, my
      dear. Nothing can be more safe.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, papa! I am so very glad. Not to be able to hinder him was so
      dreadful, when he wanted to pit Lucy and me against you. I could never
      have looked at you. I should always have felt that you had something to
      forgive me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I could not well have confounded you with Algernon, my dear,&rsquo; said Mr.
      Kendal. &lsquo;What did Pettilove mean? Do you know?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not exactly; something about grandpapa&rsquo;s old settlement; which frightened
      the Vicar, though Mrs. Dusautoy said that it was only that he fancied
      nobody could do anything right without his help. Mr. Dusautoy is more
      angry with Algernon than I thought he could be with anybody.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No one but Algernon would have ever thought of it,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal. &lsquo;I
      am sorry he has molested you, my dear. Have you any objection to let me
      see his letter?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I kept it for you, papa, and a copy of my answer. I thought though I am
      not of age, perhaps my saying I would have nothing to do with it might do
      some good.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Algernon magniloquently condoled with his sister-in-law on the injustice
      from which she and her sister had suffered, in consequence of the adverse
      influence which surrounded her brother, and generously informed her that
      she had a champion to defeat the machinations against their rights. He had
      little doubt of the futility of the document, and had written to the legal
      adviser of the late Mr. Meadows to inquire whether the will of that
      gentleman did not bar any power on the part of his grandson to dispose of
      the property. She might rely on him not to rest until she should be put in
      possession of the estate, unless it should prove to have been her
      grandfathers intention, in case of the present melancholy occurrence, that
      the elder sister should be the sole inheritrix, and he congratulated her
      on having such a protector, since, under the unfortunate circumstances,
      the sisters would have had no one to uphold their cause against their
      natural guardian.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy&rsquo;s answer was&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear Algernon,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I prefer my <i>natural guardian</i> to any other whatever. I shall for my
      part owe you no thanks for attempting to frustrate my dear brother&rsquo;s
      wishes, and to raise an unbecoming dissension. I desire that no use of my
      name may be made, and you may rest assured that I should find nothing so
      difficult to forgive as any such interference in my behalf.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                                           &lsquo;Yours truly,
                                              &lsquo;SOPHIA KENDAL.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal, &lsquo;no family ill-will is complete unless money
      matters be brought in to aggravate it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you think I did right, and spoke strongly enough, papa?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quite strongly enough,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal, suppressing a smile. &lsquo;I hope you
      wrote kindly to Lucy at the same time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One could not help that, papa; but I did say a great deal about the
      outrageous impropriety of raising the question, because I thought Algernon
      might be ashamed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal. &lsquo;Your
      grandfather&rsquo;s acquisitions have brought us little but evil hitherto, and
      now I fear that our dear Gilbert&rsquo;s endeavour to break the net which bound
      us into that system of iniquity and oppression, may cause alienation from
      poor Lucy. Sophy, you must allow no apparent coldness or neglect on her
      part to keep you from writing often and affectionately.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Maurice here came down with his mother, and as soon as there was a
      moment&rsquo;s pause, laid hold of the first book he met with, and began:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do not see the justness of the analogy to which Onuphrio refers, but
      there are many parts of that vision on which I should wish to hear the
      explanations of Philalethes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      All broke out in amazement, &lsquo;Why, Maurice, has Mrs. Dusautoy been making a
      scholar of you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! Maurice, was this your secret?&rsquo; cried Sophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had hidden his face in his mother&rsquo;s lap, and when she raised it
      struggled to keep it down, and she felt him sobbing and panting for
      breath. Mr. Kendal stroked his hair, and they tried to soothe him, but he
      started up abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t mean ever to be a plague again! So I did it. But there&mdash;when
      Ulick said it would be a comfort, you are all going to cry again, papa and
      all, and that&rsquo;s worse!&rsquo; and stamping his foot passionately, he would have
      rushed out of the room, but was held fast in his father&rsquo;s arms, and indeed
      tears were flowing fast from eyes that his brother&rsquo;s death had left dry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My child! my dear child!&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal, &lsquo;it is comfort. No one can
      rule you as by God&rsquo;s grace you can rule yourself, and your endeavours to
      do this are the greatest blessing I can ask.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      One more kiss from his mother, and she let him go. He did not know how to
      deal with emotion in himself, and hated the sight of it in others; so that
      it was better to let him burst away from them, while with one voice they
      admired, rejoiced, and interrogated Sophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know now,&rsquo; she said, the rosy glow mantling in her cheek; &lsquo;it must have
      been Mr. O&rsquo;More.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! has he been with you?&rsquo; said her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only once,&rsquo; said Sophy, her colour deepening; &lsquo;but Maurice has been in a
      great hurry every day to go to him, and I saw there was some secret. One
      day, Susan asked me to prevent Master Maurice from teaching baby such ugly
      words, that she could not sleep&mdash;not bad words, but she thought they
      were Latin. So I watched, and I heard Maurice singing out some of the
      legend of Hiawatha, and insisting on poor little Awkey telling him what
      m-i-s-h-e-n-a-h-m-a, spelt. Poor little Awk stared, as well she might, and
      obediently made the utmost efforts to say after him, Mishenahma, king of
      fishes, but he was terribly discomposed at getting nothing but
      Niffey-ninny, king of fithes. I went to her rescue, and asked what they
      were about; but Maurice thundered down on me all the Delawares and
      Mohawks, and the Choctaws and Cameches; and baby squeaked after him as
      well as she could, till I fairly stopped my ears. I thought Ulick must be
      reading the legend to him. Now I see he must have been teaching him to
      read it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can it be possible?&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal. &lsquo;He could not read words of five
      letters without spelling.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He always could do much more when he pleased than when he did not
      please,&rsquo; said Albinia. &lsquo;I believe the impulse to use his understanding was
      all that was wanting, and I am very glad the impulse came from such a
      motive.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kendal ordained that Maurice&rsquo;s reward should be learning Latin from
      himself, a perilous trial; but it proved that Mr. Kendal was really a good
      teacher for a child of spirit and courage, and Maurice had early come to
      the age when boys do better with man than with woman. He liked the honour
      and the awe of papa&rsquo;s tutorship, and learnt so well, that his father never
      believed in his past dunceship; but over studies that he did not deem
      sufficiently masculine, he could be as troublesome as ever, his attention
      absent, and his restlessness most wearisome. To an ordinary eye, he was
      little changed; but his mother felt that the great victory of the will had
      been gained, and that his <i>self</i> was endeavouring to get the better
      of the spirit of insubordination and mischief. Night after night she found
      him sleeping with the Balaklava sword by his side, and his hand clasped
      over it; and he always crept out of the way of Crimean news, though that
      he gathered up the facts was plain when he committed his sovereign to
      Ulick, with a request that it might be devoted to the comforts preparing
      to be sent to the 25th Lancers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ulick wished him to consult his mother, but this he repelled. He could not
      endure the sight of a tear in her eye, and she could not restrain them
      when that chord was touched. It was a propensity she much disliked, the
      more because she thought it looked like affectation beside Sophy, whose
      feelings never took that course, but the more ill-timed the tears, the
      more they would come, at the most common-place condolence or remote
      allusion. It was the effect of the long strain on her powers, and the
      severe shock coming suddenly after so much pressure and fatigue; moreover,
      her habits had been so long disorganized that her time seemed blank, and
      she could not rouse herself from a feeling of languor and depression. Then
      Gilbert had been always on her mind, whether at home or absent; and it did
      not seem at first as if she had enough to fill up time or thoughts&mdash;she
      absolutely found herself doing nothing, because there was nothing she
      cared to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kendal&rsquo;s first object was the fulfilment of Gilbert&rsquo;s wishes; but
      Albinia soon felt how much easier it is for women and boys to make
      schemes, than for men to bring them to effect, and how rash it is hastily
      to condemn those who tolerate abuses.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole was carefully looked over with a surveyor, and it was only then
      understood how complicated were the tenures, and how varied the covenants
      of the numerous small tenements which old Mr. Meadows had amassed. It was
      not possible to be free of the legal difficulties under at least a year,
      and plans of drainage might be impeded for want of other people&rsquo;s consent.
      Even if all had been smooth, the sacrifice of income, by destroying Tibb&rsquo;s
      Alley, and reducing the number of cottages, would be considerable.
      Meantime, the inspection had brought to light worse iniquities and greater
      wretchedness than Mr. Kendal had imagined, and his eagerness to set to
      work was tenfold. His table was heaped with sanitary reports, and his fits
      of abstraction were over the components of bad air or builder&rsquo;s estimates.
    </p>
    <p>
      It only depended on Ulick to have resumed his intimacy at Willow Lawn; but
      the habit once broken was not resumed. He was often there, but never
      without invitation; and he was not always to be had. He had less leisure,
      he was senior clerk, and the junior was dull and untrained; and he often
      had work to do far into the evening. He looked bright and well, as though
      possessed of a sense of being valuable in his own place, more conducive to
      happiness than even congeniality of employment; and Sophy, though now and
      then disappointed at his non-appearance, always had a good reason for it,
      and continued to justify Mr. Dusautoy&rsquo;s boast that the air of the hill had
      made another woman of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Visiting cards had, of course, come in numbers to Willow Lawn, but Albinia
      seemed to have caught her husband&rsquo;s aversions, and it would be dangerous
      to say how long it was before she lashed herself into setting off for a
      round of calls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing surprised her more than Miss Goldsmith&rsquo;s reception. Conscious of
      her neglect, she expected the stiff manner to be more formal than ever;
      but the welcome was almost warm, and there was something caressing in her
      fears that Miss Kendal would be tired. Mr. Goldsmith was not quite well,
      there were threatenings of gout, and his sister had persuaded him to visit
      the relations at Bristol next week; everything might safely be trusted to
      young More, and therewith came such praise of his steadiness and ability,
      that Albinia did not know which way to look when all was ascribed to Mr.
      Kendal&rsquo;s great kindness to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was too palpable to be altogether pleasant. Sophia Kendal was heiress
      enough to be a very desirable connexion for the bank. Albinia was afraid
      she should see through the lady&rsquo;s graciousness, and took her leave in
      haste; but Sophy only said, &lsquo;Do you remember, mamma, when the Goldsmiths
      thought we unsettled him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Albinia had disarmed her reply of the irony on the tip of her
      tongue, the omnibus came lumbering round the corner, and a voice proceeded
      from the rear, the door flew open, and there was a rapid exit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Face and voice, light step, and gay bearing, all were Fred&mdash;the empty
      sleeve, the sole resemblance to the shattered convalescent of a few weeks
      back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There, Albinia! I said you should see her first. You haven&rsquo;t got any
      change, have you?&rsquo; the last being addressed either to Albinia, the omnibus
      conductor, or a lady, who made a tender of two shillings, while Albinia
      ordered the luggage on to Willow Lawn, though something was faintly said
      about the inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And there!&rsquo; cried Fred, with an emphatic twist of his moustache, &lsquo;isn&rsquo;t
      she all I ever told you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The last thing was a brick,&rsquo; said Albinia, laughing, as she looked at the
      smiling, confiding, animated face, not the less pleasant for a French
      Canadian grace that recalled Genevieve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The right article for building a hut, I hope,&rsquo; she said, merrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But how and when could you have come?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This morning, from Liverpool. We did not mean to storm you in this
      manner; we meant to have settled ourselves at the inn, and walked down;
      Emily was very particular about it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you see, when he saw you, he forgot all my lectures!&rsquo; said Emily,
      taking his welcome for granted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very proper of him! But, Fred, I don&rsquo;t quite believe it yet. How long is
      it since we parted?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Six weeks; just enough to go to Canada and back, with a fortnight in the
      middle to spare.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And pray how long has Mrs. Fred existed?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Three weeks and two days;&rsquo; and turning half round to give her the benefit
      of his words, &lsquo;it was on purely philanthropic principles, because I could
      not tie my own necktie.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now could I,&rsquo; said Emily pleadingly to Sophy&mdash;&lsquo;now could I let him
      go back again alone, when he came so helpless, and looking so dreadfully
      ill?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what are you going to do?&rsquo; asked Albinia. &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t join again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Join! why not? Here&rsquo;s a hand for a horse, and an arm for a wife, and the
      rest will be done much better for me than ever it was before.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But with her? and at Sebastopol!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the very thing&rsquo;&rsquo; cried the colonel, again turning about. &lsquo;Nothing
      will serve her but to show how a backwoodsman&rsquo;s daughter can live in a
      hut.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what will the general say?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The general,&rsquo; cried Emily, &lsquo;will endure me better as a fact than as a
      prospect; and we will teach him that a lady is not all made of nerves and
      of fancies! See what he will say if we let him into our paradise!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Fred brightened, though Albinia&rsquo;s inquiry had for a moment taken him a
      little aback. The one being whom he dreaded was General Ferrars, for whom
      he cared a thousand times more than for his own elder brother, and he was
      soon speculating, with his usual insouciance, as to how his announcement
      might have been received by his lordship, and whether the aunts would look
      at them as they went through London.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kendal met them at the gate, amazed at the avalanche of luggage, but
      well pleased, for he had grown very fond of Fred, and had been very
      anxious about him, thinking him broken and enfeebled for life, and hardly
      expecting him to return from his mad expedition. He was slow to believe
      his eyes and ears when he beheld a hale, handsome, vigorous man, full of
      life and activity, but his welcome and congratulations were of the
      warmest. He could far better stand a sudden inroad than if he had had to
      meditate for a week on entertaining the bride. Not that the bride wanted
      entertainment, except waiting upon her husband, who let himself be many
      degrees less handy than at Malta, for the pleasure of her attentions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps the person least gratified was Maurice; for the child shrank with
      shy reverence from him whom his brother had saved, and would as soon have
      thought of making a plaything of Gilbert&rsquo;s sword as of having fun with the
      survivor. The sight of such a merry man was a shock, and he abruptly
      repelled all attempts at playing with him, and kept apart with a big book
      on a chair before him, a Kendalism for which he amply compensated when
      familiarity had diminished his awe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kendal, though little disposed to exert himself to talk, liked to
      watch his wife reviving into animation, and Sophy taking a full share in
      the glee with which Emily enjoyed turning the laugh against the
      good-natured soldier. In the midst of their flush of joy there was a
      tender consideration about the young couple, such as to hinder their tone
      from jarring. Indeed, it was less consideration than fellow-feeling, for
      Gilbert Kendal had become enshrined in the depths of Fred&rsquo;s heart; while
      to Emily the visit was well-nigh a pilgrimage. All her hero-worship was
      directed to the youth who had guarded her soldier&rsquo;s life, nursed him in
      his sickness, and, as he averred, inspired him with serious thoughts.
      Poor, failing, timid, penitent Gilbert was to her a very St. George, and
      every relic of him was viewed with reverence; she composed a countenance
      for him from his father&rsquo;s fine features, and fitted the fragments of his
      history into an ideal, till Sophy, after being surprised and gratified,
      began to view Gilbert through a like halo, and to rank him with his twin
      brother. Friendship was a new and agreeable phase of life to Sophy, who
      found a suitable companion in such an open-hearted person, simpler in
      nature, and fresher than herself, free from English commonplaces, though
      older and of more standing. She expanded and brightened wonderfully, and
      Emily, imagining her a female Gilbert, was devoted to her, and thought her
      a marvel of learning, depth, goodness, and humility, the more striking for
      her tinge of grave pensiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, Albinia,&rsquo; said the colonel, &lsquo;didn&rsquo;t I hear that it was your handsome
      daughter who is married?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, poor Lucy was always called our pretty one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;More admired than her sister? Why, she never could have had a
      countenance!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Albinia, highly gratified by the opinion of such a
      connoisseur. &lsquo;I always told Winifred that Sophy was the beauty, but she
      has only lately had health or animation to set her off.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I declare, when we overtook you in the street, she looked a perfect
      Spanish princess, in her black robes and great shady hat. You ought always
      to keep her in black. Ha! Emily, what are you smiling at?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife looked up into his face with mischievous shyness in her eyes, as
      if she wanted him to say what would be a liberty in her. Somebody else had
      overtaken the ladies nearly at the same moment, and Albinia exulted in
      perceiving that the embellishment had been observed by others besides
      herself. She did not look so severe but that Fred was encouraged to
      repeat, &lsquo;Only lately had health or animation? When Irish winds blow this
      way, I fancy&mdash;But what will the aunts say?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They are not Sophy&rsquo;s aunts, whatever they are to you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What will Kendal say? which is more to the purpose.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! he saw it first; he will be delighted; but you must not say a word to
      him, for it can&rsquo;t come to anything just now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia was thus confirmed in her anticipations, and the bridal pair, only
      wishing everybody to be as happy as themselves, took the matter up with
      such vivid interest and amusement, that she was rather afraid of a
      manifestation such as to shock either her husband or the parties
      themselves; but Fred was too much of a gentleman, and Emily too
      considerate, for anything perilously marked. Only she thought Emily need
      not have been so decided in making room for Ulick next to Sophy, when they
      were all looking out at the young moon at the conservatory-door that
      evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then Emily took her husband&rsquo;s arm, and insisted on going down the
      garden to be introduced to English nightingales; and though she was told
      they never had come there in the memory of man, she was bent on doing as
      she would be done by, and drew him alone the silvered paths, among the
      black shadows of the trees; and Ulick asked Sophy if she wished to go too.
      She looked as if she should like it very much; he fetched a couple of
      cloaks ont of the hall, put her into one, and ran after Mrs. Ferrars with
      the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well!&rsquo; thought Albinia, as she stood at the conservatory-door, &lsquo;how much
      more boldness and tact some people have than others! If I had lived a
      hundred years, I should not have managed it so well!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s become of them?&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal, as she went back to the
      drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gone to listen for nightingales!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nightingales! How could you let them go into the river-fog?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Emily was bent upon it; she is too much of a bride not to have her way.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Umph! I wonder Sophy was so foolish.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They came back in a quarter of an hour. No nightingales; and Fred was
      indulging in reminiscences of bull-frogs; the two ladies were rapturous on
      the effect of the moonbeams in the ripple of the waters, and the soft
      furry white mist rising over the meadows. Ulick shivered, and leant over
      the fire to breathe a drier air, bantering the ladies for their
      admiration, and declaring that Mrs. Ferrars had taken the moan of an
      imprisoned house-dog for the nightingale, which he disdainfully imitated
      with buzz, zizz, and guggle, assuring her she had had no loss; but he
      looked rather white and chilled. Sophy whispered something to her papa,
      who rang the bell, and ordered in wine and hot water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There, Emily,&rsquo; said Albinia, when he had taken his leave; &lsquo;what shall we
      say to your nightingales, if Mr. O&rsquo;More catches his ague again?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, there are moments when people don&rsquo;t catch agues,&rsquo; said Fred. &lsquo;He
      would be a poor fellow to catch an ague after all that, though,
      by-the-bye, it is not a place to go to at night without a cigar.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia was on thorns, lest Sophy should be offended; but though her
      cheeks lighted up, and she was certainly aware of some part of their
      meaning, either she did not believe in the possibility of any one
      bantering her, or else the assumption was more agreeable than the
      presumption was disagreeable. She endured with droll puzzled dignity, when
      Fred teased her anxiety the next day to know whether Mr. O&rsquo;More had felt
      any ill effects; and it really appeared as if she liked him better for
      what might have been expected to be a dire affront; but then he was a man
      whose manner enabled to do and say whatever he pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily never durst enter on the subject with her, but had more than one
      confidential little gossip with Albinia, and repeatedly declared that she
      hoped to be in England when &lsquo;it&rsquo; took place. Indeed that week&rsquo;s visit made
      them all so intimate, that it was not easy to believe how recent was the
      acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The aunts had been so much disappointed at Fred&rsquo;s desertion, so much
      discomfited at his recovery contrary to all predictions, and so much
      annoyed at his marriage, that it took all their kindness, and his Crimean
      fame, to make them invite him and his colonial wife to the Family Office,
      to be present at the royal distribution of medals. However, the good
      ladies did their duty; and Emily and Sophy parted with promises of
      letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      The beginning of the correspondence was as full a description of the
      presentation of the medals as could be given by a person who only saw one
      figure wherever she went, and to whom the great incident of the day was,
      that the gracious and kindhearted Queen had herself fastened the
      left-handed colonel&rsquo;s medal as well as Emily could have done it herself!
      There was another medal, with two clasps, that came to Bayford, and which
      was looked at in pensive but not unhappy silence. &lsquo;You shall have it some
      day, Maurice, but not now,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal, and all felt that now meant
      his own lifetime. It was placed where Gilbert would well have liked to see
      it, beside his brother Edmund&rsquo;s watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily made Mrs. Annesley and Miss Ferrars more fond of her in three days,
      than eleven years had made them of Winifred; too fond, indeed, for they
      fell to preaching to Fred upon the horrors of Sebastopol, till they
      persuaded him that he was a selfish wretch, and brought him to decree that
      she should stay with them during his absence. But, as Emily observed, that
      was not what she left home for; she demolished his arguments with a small
      amount of playing at petulance, and triumphantly departed for the East,
      leaving Aunt Mary crying over her as a predestined victim.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last thing Fred did before sailing, was to send Albinia a letter from
      his brother, that she might see &lsquo;how very kind and cordial Belraven was,&rsquo; 
      besides something that concerned her more nearly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Belraven was civil when it cost him nothing, and had lately regarded
      his inconvenient younger brother with favour, as bringing him distinction,
      and having gained two steps without purchase, removed, too, by his present
      rank, and the pension for his wound, from being likely to become
      chargeable to him; so he had written such brotherly congratulations, that
      good honest Fred was quite affected. He was even discursive enough to
      mention some connexions of the young man who had been with Fred in the
      Crimea, a Mr. Cavendish Dusautoy, a very good sort of fellow, who gave
      excellent dinners, and was a pleasant yachting companion. His wife was
      said to be very pretty and pleasing, but she had arrived at Genoa very
      unwell, had been since confined, and was not yet able to see any one. It
      was said to be the effect of her distress for the death of her brother,
      and the estrangement from her family, who had behaved very ill about his
      property. Had not Albinia Ferrars married into that family?
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia knew enough of her noble relative to be aware that good dinners
      and obsequiousness were the way to his esteem, and Algernon&rsquo;s was the sort
      of arrogance that would stoop to adore a coronet. All this was nothing,
      however, to the idea of Lucy, ill in that strange place, with no one to
      care for her but her hard master. Albinia sometimes thought of going to
      find her out at Genoa; but this was too utterly wild and impossible, and
      nothing could be done but to write letters of affectionate inquiry,
      enclosing them to Lord Belraven.
    </p>
    <p>
      Algernon&rsquo;s answer was solemn, and as brief as he could make anything. He
      was astonished that the event bad escaped the notice of the circle at
      Bayford, since he believed it had appeared in all the principal European
      newspapers; and his time had been so fully occupied, that he had imagined
      that intimation sufficient, since it was evident from the tone of the
      recent correspondence, that the family of Bayford were inclined to drop
      future intercourse. He was obliged for the inquiries for Lucy, and was
      happy to say she was recovering favourably, though the late unfortunate
      events, and the agitation caused by letters from home, had affected her so
      seriously, that they had been detained at Genoa for nearly four months to
      his great inconvenience, instead of pushing on to Florence and Rome. It
      had been some compensation that he had become extremely intimate with that
      most agreeable and superior person, Lord Belraven, who had consented to
      become sponsor to his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy wrote to Albinia. Poor thing, the letter was the most childishly
      expressed, and the least childishly felt, she had ever written; its whole
      aspect was weak and wobegone; yet there was less self-pity, and more
      endeavour to make the best of it, than before. She had the dearest little
      baby in the world; but he was very delicate, and she wished mamma would
      send out an English nurse, for she could not bear that Italian woman&mdash;her
      black eyes looked so fierce, and she was sure it was not safe to have
      those immense pins in her hair. Expense was nothing, but she should never
      be happy till she had an Englishwoman about him, especially now that she
      was getting better, and Algernon would want her to come out again with
      him. Dear Algernon, he had lost the Easter at Rome for her sake, but
      perhaps it was a good thing, for he was often out in Lord Belraven&rsquo;s
      yacht, and she could be quiet with baby. She did wish baby to have had her
      dear brothers&rsquo; names, but Algernon would not consent. Next Tuesday he was
      to be christened; and then followed a string of mighty names, long enough
      for a Spanish princess, beginning with Belraven!!!
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy Dusautoy&rsquo;s dreary condition in the midst of all that wealth could
      give, was a contrast to Emily Ferrars&rsquo; buoyant delight in the burrow which
      was her first married home, and proved a paradise to many a stray officer,
      aye, maybe, to Lieutenant-General Sir William Ferrars himself. Her letters
      were charming, especially a detail of Fred meeting Bryan O&rsquo;More coming out
      of the trenches, grim, hungry, and tired, having recently kicked a newly
      alighted shell down from the parapet, with the cool words, &lsquo;Be off with
      you, you ugly baste you;&rsquo; of his wolfish appetite after having been long
      reduced to simple rations, though he kept a curly black lamb loose about
      his hut, because he hadn&rsquo;t the heart to kill it; and it served him for bed
      if not for board, all his rugs and blankets having flown off in the
      hurricane, or been given to the wounded; he had been quite affronted at
      the suggestion that a Galway pig was as well lodged as himself&mdash;it
      was an insult to any respectable Irish animal!
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia sent Maurice to summon Ulick to enjoy the letter in store for him.
      He looked grave and embarrassed, and did not light up as usual at Bryan&rsquo;s
      praises. He said that his aunt, who had written to him on business, had
      given a bad account of Mr. Goldsmith, but Albinia hardly thought this
      accounted for his preoccupation, and was considering how to probe it, when
      her brother Maurice opened the door. &lsquo;Ulick O&rsquo;More! that&rsquo;s right; the very
      man I was in search of!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How&rsquo;s Winifred, Maurice?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Getting on wonderfully well. I really think she is going to make a start,
      after all! and she is in such spirits herself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And the boy?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, a thumping great fellow! I promise you he&rsquo;ll be a match for your
      Maurice.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do believe it is to reward Winifred for sparing you in the spring when
      we wanted you so much! Come, sit down, and wait for Edmund.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No; I&rsquo;ve not a moment to stay. I&rsquo;m to meet Bury again at Woodside at six
      o&rsquo;clock, he drove me there, and I walked on, looking in at your lodgings
      by the way, Ulick.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not there now. I am keeping guard at the bank.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So they told me. Well, I hope your guard is not too strict for you to
      come over to Fairmead on Sunday; we want you to do our boy the kindness to
      be his godfather!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy blushed with approving gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t consider that it will be a sinecure&mdash;he squalls in such a
      characteristic manner that I am convinced he will rival his cousin here in
      all amiable and amenable qualities; so I consider it particularly
      desirable that he should be well provided with great disciplinarians.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You certainly could not find any one more accomplished in teaching dunces
      to read,&rsquo; said Albinia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When their mammas have taught them already!&rsquo; added Ulick, laughing.
      &lsquo;Thank you; but you know I can&rsquo;t sleep out; Hyder Ali and I are
      responsible for a big chest of sovereigns, and all the rest of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nor could I lodge you at present; so we are agreed. My proposition is
      that you should drive my sister over on Sunday morning. My wife is
      wearying for a sight of her; and she has not been at Fairmead on a Sunday
      since she left it, eh, Albinia?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose for such a purpose it is not wrong to use the horse,&rsquo; she said,
      her eyes sparkling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you might put my friend Maurice between you, if you can&rsquo;t go out
      pleasuring without him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I scorn you, sir; Maurice is as good as gold; I shall leave him at home,
      I think, to prove that I can&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the reward of merit!&rsquo; exclaimed Sophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She expects my children to corrupt him!&rsquo; quoth Mr. Ferrars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For shame, Maurice; that&rsquo;s on purpose to make me bring him. Well, we&rsquo;ll
      see what papa says, and if he thinks the new black horse strong enough, or
      to be trusted with Mr. O&rsquo;More.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I only wish &lsquo;twas a jaunting car!&rsquo; cried Ulick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what&rsquo;s the boy&rsquo;s name to be? Not Belraven, I conclude, like my
      unfortunate grandson&mdash;Maurice, I hope.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No; the precedent of his namesake would be too dangerous. I believe he is
      to be Edmund Ulick. Don&rsquo;t take it as too personal, Ulick, for it was the
      name of our mutual connexion.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I take the personal part though, Maurice; and thank you, said Albinia,
      and Mr. Ferrars looked more happy and joyous than any time since his
      wife&rsquo;s health had begun to fail. Always cheerful, and almost always taking
      matters up in the most lively point of view, it was only by comparison
      that want of spirits in him could be detected; and it was chiefly by the
      vanishing of a certain careworn, anxious expression about his eyes, and by
      the ring of his merry laugh, that Albinia knew that he thought better of
      his wife&rsquo;s state than for the last five or six years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia and Ulick drove off at six o&rsquo;clock on a lovely summer Sunday
      morning, with Maurice between them in a royal state of felicity. That long
      fresh drive, past summer hay-fields sleeping in their silver bath of dew,
      and villages tardily awakening to the well-earned Sunday rest, was not the
      least pleasant part of the day; and yet it was completely happy, not even
      clouded by one outbreak of Master Maurice. Luckily for him, Mary had a
      small class, who absorbed her superabundant love of rule; and little Alby
      was a fair-haired, apple-cheeked maiden of five, who awoke both admiration
      and chivalry, and managed to coquet with him and Ulick both at once, so
      that Willie had no disrespect to his sisters to resent.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was exemplary at church, well-behaved at dinner, and so little on his
      mamma&rsquo;s mind, that she had a delightful renewal of her acquaintance with
      the Sunday-school, and a leisurable gossip with Mrs. Reid and the two Miss
      Reids, collectively and individually; but the best of all was a long quiet
      tete-a-tete with Winifred.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the evening service, Mr. Ferrars himself carried his
      newly-christened boy back to the mother, and paused that his sister might
      come with him, and they might feel like the old times, when the three had
      been alone together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Winifred, when he had left them, &lsquo;it is very pretty playing at
      it; but one cannot be the same.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nor would one exactly wish it,&rsquo; said Albinia; &lsquo;though I think you are
      going to be more the same.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps,&rsquo; said Winifred; &lsquo;the worst of being ill is that it does wear
      one&rsquo;s husband so! When he came in, and tried to make me fancy we were gone
      back to Willie&rsquo;s time, I could not help thinking how different you both
      looked.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, so much the better and more respectable,&rsquo; said Albinia. &lsquo;You know I
      always wanted to grow old; I don&rsquo;t want to stop short like your sister
      Anne, who looks as much the child of the house as ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish you had as few cares as Anne. Look; I declare that&rsquo;s a grey hair!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know. I like it; now Sophy is growing young, and I&rsquo;m growing old, it is
      all correct.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Old, indeed!&rsquo; ejaculated Winifred, looking at her fair fresh complexion
      and bright features; &lsquo;don&rsquo;t try for that, when even Edmund is not grey.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes he is,&rsquo; said Albinia, gravely; &lsquo;Malta sowed many white threads in his
      black head, and worry about those buildings has brought more.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Worry; I&rsquo;m very sorry to hear of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes; the tenures are so troublesome, and everybody is so cantankerous. If
      he wanted to set up some pernicious manufacture, it could not be worse!
      The Osbornes, after having lived with Tibb&rsquo;s Alley close to them all their
      lives, object to the almshouses! Mr. Baron wont have the new drains
      carried through his little strip of land. The Town Council think we are
      going to poison the water; and Pettilove, and everybody else who owns a
      wretched tenement, that we shall increase the wants of their tenants, and
      lower their rents. If it be carried through, it will be by that sheer
      force in going his own way that Edmund can exert when he chooses.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And he will?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O, yes, no fear of that; he goes on, avoiding seeing or hearing what he
      has not to act upon; but worse than all are the people themselves; Tibb&rsquo;s
      Alley all has notice to quit, but none of them can be got rid of till
      Martinmas, and some not till Lady-day, and the beer-house people are in
      such a rage! The turn-out of the public-houses come and roar at our gate
      on Saturday nights; and they write up things on the wall against him! and
      one day they threw over into the garden what little Awkey called a poor
      dear dead pussy. I believe they tell them all sorts of absurd things about
      his tyranny; poor creatures.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t you get it stopped?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Edmund wont summon any one, because he thinks it would do more harm than
      good. He says it will pass off; but it grieves him more than he shows: he
      thinks he could once have made himself more popular: but I don&rsquo;t know, it
      is a horrid set.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thought you said he was in good spirits.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And so he is: he never gets depressed and unwilling to be spoken to. He
      is ready to take interest in everything; and always so busy! When I
      remember how he never seemed to be obliged to attend to anything, I laugh
      at the contrast; and yet he goes about it all so gravely and slowly, that
      it never seems like a change.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In this and other home talk nearly an hour had passed, when Mr. Ferrars
      returned. &lsquo;Are you come to tell me to go?&rsquo; said Albinia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not particularly,&rsquo; he said, in a tone that made her laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; said Winifred. &lsquo;I want a great deal more of her. Where have you
      been?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have been to see old Wilks; Ulick walked down with me. By-the-bye,
      Albinia, what nonsense has Fred&rsquo;s wife been talking to his brother?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Emily does not talk nonsense!&rsquo; fired up Albinia, colouring, nevertheless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The worse for her, then! However, it seems Bryan has disturbed this poor
      fellow very much, by congratulating him on his prospects at Willow Lawn.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! that is what made him so distant and cautious, is it?&rsquo; laughed
      Albinia. &lsquo;I think Mrs. Emily might as well not have betrayed it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Betrayed! What could have passed?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! Emily and Fred saw it as plain as I did. Why, it does not do credit
      to your discernment, Maurice; papa found it out long ago, and told me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Kendal did?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, that he did, and did not mind the notion at all; rather liked it, in
      fact.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well!&rsquo; said Mr. Ferrars, in a different tone, &lsquo;it is a very queer
      business! I certainly did not think the lad showed any symptoms. He said
      he had heard gossip about it before, and had tried to be careful; his aunt
      talked to him once, but, as he said, it would be nothing but the rankest
      treason to think of such a thing, on the terms on which he is treated.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ay, that&rsquo;s it!&rsquo; said Albinia; &lsquo;he acts most perfectly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perfectly indeed, if that were acting,&rsquo; said Mr. Ferrars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what made him speak to you?&rsquo; asked Winifred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He wanted to consult me. He said it was very hard on him, for all the
      pleasure he had came from his intercourse with Willow Lawn; and he could
      not bear to keep at a distance, because it looked as if he had not
      forgotten the old folly about the caricature; but he was afraid of the
      report coming to your ears or Mr. Kendal&rsquo;s, because you would think it so
      wrong and shameful an abuse of your kindness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And that&rsquo;s his whole concern?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So he told me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what advice did you give him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I told him Bayford was bent on gossip, and no one heeded it less than my
      respected brother and sister.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That was famous of you, Maurice. I was afraid you would have put it upon
      his honour and the state of his own heart.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sooth to say, I did not think his heart appeared very ticklish.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! Maurice, Maurice! But you&rsquo;ve not been there to see the hot fits and
      the cold fits! It is a very fine thermometer whether he says Sophy or Miss
      Kendal.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you say Edmund perceived this?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Much you would trust my unassisted &lsquo;cuteness! I tell you he did, and that
      it will make him happier than anything.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well; then my advice will have done no harm. I did not think there
      had been so much self-control in an Irishman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Had he not better say, so much blindness in the rector of Fairmead?&rsquo; 
      laughed Albinia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And pray what course is the affair to take?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The present, I suppose. Some catastrophe will occur at last to prove to
      him that we honour him, and don&rsquo;t view it as outrageous presumption; and
      then&mdash;oh! there can be no doubt that he will have a share in the
      bank; and Sophy may buy toleration for his round O. After all, he has the
      best of it as to ancestry, and we Kendals need not turn up our noses at
      banking.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think he will be too proud to address her, except on equality as to
      money matters.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pride is sometimes quelled and love free,&rsquo; said Albinia. &lsquo;No, no; content
      yourself with having given the best advice in the world, with your eyes
      fast shut!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And Albinia went home in high spirits.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Not long afterwards, Ulick O&rsquo;More was summoned to Bristol, where his uncle
      had become suddenly worse; but he had only reached Hadminster when a
      telegraph met him with the news of Mr. Goldsmith&rsquo;s death, and orders to
      remain at his post.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came to the Kendals in the evening in great grief; he had really come
      to love and esteem his uncle, and he was very unhappy at having lost the
      chance of a reconciliation for his mother. As her chief friend and
      confidant, he knew that she regarded the alienation of her own family as
      the punishment of her disobedient marriage, and that his own appointment
      had been valued chiefly as an opening towards fraternal feeling, and
      reproached himself for not having made more direct efforts to induce his
      uncle to enter into personal intercourse with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I had only ventured it before he went to Bristol,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;I was a
      fool not to have done so; and there, the Goldsmiths detest the very name
      of us! Why could they not have telegraphed for me? I might have heard what
      would have done my mother&rsquo;s heart good for the rest of her life. I am sure
      my poor uncle wanted to ease his mind!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;May he not have sent some communication direct to her?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I trust he did! I have long thought he only kept her aloof from habit,
      and felt kindly towards her all the time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And never could persuade himself to make a move towards her until too
      late,&rsquo; said Albinia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. Nothing comes home to one more than the words, &ldquo;Agree with thine
      adversary quickly whiles thou art in the way with him.&rdquo; If once one comes
      to think there&rsquo;s creditable pride in holding out, there&rsquo;s no end to it, or
      else too much end.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Goldsmith was persevering in the example his father had set him,&rsquo; 
      said Mr. Kendal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ay! my mother never blamed either, and I&rsquo;m afraid, if the truth were
      told, my father was hot enough too, though it would all have been bygones
      with him long ago, if they would have let it. But I was thinking just then
      of my own foolishness last winter, when I would not grant you it was
      pride, Mrs. Kendal, for fear I should have to repent of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What has brought you to see that it was?&rsquo; asked she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One comes to a better mind when the fit is off,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;I hope I will
      not be as bad next time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope we shall never give you a next time,&rsquo; said Albinia; &lsquo;for neither
      party is comfortable, perched on a high horse.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you see,&rsquo; continued Ulick, &lsquo;it is hard for us to give up our pride,
      because it is the only thing we&rsquo;ve got of our own, and has been meat,
      drink, and clothing to us for many a year.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So no wonder you make the most of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;True; I think a very high born and very rich man might be humble,&rsquo; said
      Ulick, so meditatively that they laughed; but Sophy said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, that is not a paradox; the real difficulty is not in willingly
      yielding, but in taking what we cannot help.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Ulick, &lsquo;I hope it is not pride not to intend working under
      Andrew Goldsmith.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you consider that as your fate?&rsquo; asked Albinia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never my fate,&rsquo; said Ulick, quickly; &lsquo;hardly even my alternative, for he
      would like to put up a notice, &ldquo;No Irish need apply.&rdquo; We had enough of
      each other last winter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And do you suppose,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal, &lsquo;that Mr. Goldsmith has left your
      position exactly the same?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve no reason to think otherwise. I refused all connexion with the bank
      if it was to interfere with my name. I don&rsquo;t think it unlikely that he may
      have left me a small compliment in the way of shares; but if so, I shall
      sell them, and make them keep me at Oxford. I&rsquo;m not too old yet!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then the work of these four years is wasted,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal, gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, indeed,&rsquo; cried Ulick; &lsquo;not if it takes me where I&rsquo;ve always longed to
      be! Or, if not, I flatter myself I&rsquo;m accountant enough to be an agent in
      my own country.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Anything to get away from here,&rsquo; said Albinia, with a shade of asperity,
      provoked by the spirit of enterprise in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;After all, it is a bit of a place,&rsquo; said Ulick; &lsquo;and the office parlour
      is not just a paradise! Then &lsquo;tis all on such a narrow scale, too little
      to absorb one, and too much to let one do anything else; I see how larger
      transactions might be engrossing, but this is mere cramping and worrying;
      I know I could do better for my family in the end than by what I can screw
      out of my salary now; and if it is no longer to give my poor mother a
      sense of expiation, as she calls it, why, then, the cage-door is open.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes glittered, and Sophy exclaimed, &lsquo;Yes; and now the training is
      over, it has made you fitter to fly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It has,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;and I&rsquo;m thankful for it. Without being here, I would
      never have learnt application&mdash;nor some better things, I hope.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They scarcely saw him again till after the funeral, when late in the day
      he came into the drawing-room, and saying that his aunt was pretty well
      and composed, he knelt down on the floor with the little Awk, and silently
      built up a tower with her wooden bricks. His hand trembled nervously at
      first, but gradually steadied as the elevation became critical; and a
      smile of interest lighted his face as he became absorbed in raising the
      structure to the last brick, holding back the eager child with one hand
      lest she should overthrow it. Completion, triumph, a shock, a downfall!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; cried the elder Albinia, unable to submit to the suspense.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Telle est la vie,&rsquo; answered Ulick, smiling sadly as he passed his hand
      over his brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s too bad of him,&rsquo; broke out Mrs. Kendal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thought you were prepared,&rsquo; said Sophy, severely, disappointed to see
      him so much discomposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How should I be prepared,&rsquo; said he, petulantly, &lsquo;for the whole concern,
      house, and bank, and all the rest of it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Left to you?&rsquo; was the cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Every bit of it, and an annuity apiece charged on it to my mother and
      aunt for their lives! My aunt told me how it came about. It was all that
      fellow Andrew&rsquo;s fault.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Or misfortune,&rsquo; murmured Albinia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My poor uncle had made a will in Andrew&rsquo;s favour long before my time, and
      at Bristol he wanted to make some arrangement for my mother and for me;
      but it seems Mr. Andrew took exception at me&mdash;would not promise to
      continue me on, nor to give me a share in the business, and at last my
      uncle was so much disgusted, that he sent for a lawyer and cut Andrew out
      of his will altogether. My aunt says he went on asking for me, and it was
      Andrew&rsquo;s fault that they wrote instead of telegraphing. You can&rsquo;t think
      what kind messages he sent to me;&rsquo; and Ulick&rsquo;s eyes filled with tears. &lsquo;My
      poor uncle, away from home, and with that selfish fellow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did he send any message to your mother?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes! he told my aunt to write to her that he was sorry they had been
      strangers so long, and that&mdash;I&rsquo;d been like a son to him. I&rsquo;m sure I
      wish I had been. I dare say he would have let me if I had not flown out
      about my O. I could have saved changing it without making such an
      intolerable row, and then he might have died more at peace with the
      world.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At peace with you at least he did.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I trust so. But if I could only have been by his side, and felt myself a
      comfort, and thanked him with all my heart. Maybe he would have listened
      to me, and not have sown ill-will between Andrew and me, by giving neither
      what we would like.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you expect us to be sorry?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nay, I came to be helped out of my ingratitude and discontent at finding
      the cage-door shut, and myself chained to the oar; for as things are left,
      I could not get it off my hands without giving up my mother&rsquo;s interests
      and my aunt&rsquo;s. Besides, my poor uncle left me an entreaty to keep things
      up creditably like himself, and do justice by the bank. It is as if, poor
      man, it was an idol that he had been high priest to, and wanted me to be
      the same&mdash;ay, and sacrifice too.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nay, there are two ways of working, two kinds of sacrifice; and besides,
      you are still working for your mother.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So I am, but without the hope she had before. To be sure, it would be
      affluence at home, or would be if she could have it in her own hands.
      Little Redmond shall have the best of educations! And we must mind there
      is something in advance by the time Bryan wants to purchase his company.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia asked how his aunt liked the arrangement. It seemed that Andrew
      had offended her nearly as much as her brother, and that she was clinging
      to Ulick as her great comfort and support; he did not like to stay long
      away from her, but he had rushed down to Willow Lawn to avoid the jealous
      congratulations of the cousinhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will hardly keep from glad people,&rsquo; said Albinia. &lsquo;You must shut
      yourself up if you cannot be congratulated. How rejoiced Mr. Dusautoy will
      be!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Whatever is, is best,&rsquo; sighed Ulick. &lsquo;I shall mind less when the first is
      past! I must go and entertain all these people at dinner!&rsquo; and he groaned.
      &lsquo;Good evening. Heigh ho! I wonder if our Banshee will think me worth
      keening for?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope she will have no occasion yet,&rsquo; said Albinia, as he shut the door;
      &lsquo;but she will be a very foolish Banshee if she does not, for she will
      hardly find such another O&rsquo;More! Well, Sophy, my dear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We should have missed him,&rsquo; said Sophy, as grave as a judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia&rsquo;s heart beat high with the hope that Ulick would soon perceive
      sufficient consolation for remaining at Bayford, but of course he could
      make no demonstration while Miss Goldsmith continued with him. She made
      herself very dependent on him, and he devoted his evenings to her solace.
      He had few leisure moments, for the settlement of his affairs occupied
      him, and full attention was most important to establish confidence at this
      critical juncture, when it might be feared that his youth, his nation, and
      Andrew Goldsmith&rsquo;s murmurs might tell against him. Mr. Kendal set the
      example of putting all his summer rents into his hands, and used his
      influence to inspire trust; and fortunately the world had become so much
      accustomed to transacting affairs with him, that the country business
      seemed by no means inclined to fall away. Still there was much hard work
      and some perplexity, the Bristol connexion made themselves troublesome,
      and the ordinary business was the heavier from the clerks being both so
      young and inexperienced that he was obliged to exercise close supervision.
      It was guessed, too, that he was not happy about the effect of the influx
      of wealth at home, and that he feared it would only add to the number of
      horses and debts.
    </p>
    <p>
      He soon looked terribly fagged and harassed, and owned that he envied Mr.
      Hope, who had just received the promise of a district church, in course of
      building under Colonel Bury&rsquo;s auspices, about four miles from Fairmead. To
      work his way through the University and take Holy Orders had been Ulick&rsquo;s
      ambition; he would gladly have endured privation for such an object, and
      it did seem hard that such aspirations should be so absolutely frustrated,
      and himself forced into the stream of uncongenial, unintellectual toil, in
      so obscure and uninviting a sphere. The resignation of all lingering hope
      of escape, and the effort to be contented, cost him more than even his
      original breaking in; and Mr. Kendal one day found him sitting in his
      little office parlour unable to think or to speak under a terrible
      visitation of his autumnal tormentor, brow-ague.
    </p>
    <p>
      This made Mr. Kendal take to serious expostulation. It was impossible to
      go on in this way; why did he not send for a brother to help him?
    </p>
    <p>
      Ulick could not restrain a smile at the fruitlessness of thinking of
      assistance of this kind from his elder brothers, and as to little Redmond,
      the only younger one still to be disposed of, he hoped to do better things
      for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then send for a sister.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He hoped he might bring Rose over when his aunt was gone, but he could not
      shut those two up together at any price.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal, rather angrily, &lsquo;get an experienced, trustworthy
      clerk, so as to be able to go from home, or give yourself some
      relaxation.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I inquired about such a person, but there&rsquo;s the salary; and where
      would be the chance of getting Redmond to school?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think your father might see to that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Ulick had no answer to make to this. The legacy to Mrs. O&rsquo;More might
      nearly as well have been thrown into the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal, walking about the room, &lsquo;why don&rsquo;t you keep a
      horse?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As a less costly animal than brother, sister, or clerk?&rsquo; said Ulick,
      laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your health will prove more costly than all the rest if you do not take
      care.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, my aunt told me it would be respectable and promote confidence if I
      lived like a gentleman and kept my horse. I&rsquo;ll see about it,&rsquo; said Ulick,
      in a more persuadable tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The seeing about it resulted in the arrival of a genuine product of county
      Galway, a long-legged, raw-boned hunter, with a wild, frightened eye,
      quivering, suspicious-looking ears, and an ill-omened name compounded of
      kill and of kick, which Maurice alone endeavoured to pronounce; also an
      outside car, very nearly as good as new. This last exceeded Ulick&rsquo;s
      commission, but it had been such a bargain, that Connel had not been able
      to resist it, indeed it cost more in coming over than the original price;
      but Ulick nearly danced round it, promising Mrs. and Miss Kendal that when
      new cushioned and new painted they would find it beat everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not quite so envious of Mr. Hope when he devoted the early morning
      hours to Killye-kickye, as the incorrect world called his steed, and, if
      the truth must be told, he first began to realize the advantages of
      wealth, when he set his name down among the subscribers to the hounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was this the only subscription to which he was glad to set his name;
      there were others where Mr. Dusautoy wanted funds, and Mr. Kendal&rsquo;s
      difficulties were lessened by having another lord of the soil on his side.
      Some exchanges brought land enough within their power to make drainage
      feasible, and Ulick started the idea that it would be better to locate the
      almshouses at the top of the hill, on the site of Madame Belmarche&rsquo;s old
      house, than to place them where Tibb&rsquo;s Alley at present was, close to the
      river, and far from church.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kendal&rsquo;s plans were unpopular, and two or three untoward circumstances
      combined to lead to his being regarded as a tyrant. He could not do things
      gently, and had not a conciliating manner. Had he been more free spoken,
      real oppression would have been better endured than benefits against
      people&rsquo;s will. He interfered to prevent some Sunday trading; and some of
      the Tibb&rsquo;s Alley tenants who ought to have gone at midsummer, chose to
      stay on and set him at defiance till they had to be forcibly ejected;
      whereupon Ulick O&rsquo;More showed that he was not thoroughly Anglicised by
      demanding if, under such circumstances, it was safe to keep the window
      shutters unclosed at night, Mr. Kendal&rsquo;s head was such a beautiful mark
      under the lamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      If not a mark for a pistol, he was one for the disaffected blackguard
      papers, which made up a pathetic case of a helpless widow with her bed
      taken away from under her, ending with certain vague denunciations which
      were read with roars of applause at the last beer shop which could not be
      cleared till Christmas, while the closing of the rest sent herds thither;
      and papers were nightly read; representing the Nabob expelling the
      industrious from the beloved cottages of their ancestors, by turns, to
      swell his own overgrown garden, or to found a convent, whence, as a
      disguised Jesuit, he meant to convert all Bayford to popery.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Albinia wrote to Genevieve, they were in a state of siege, for only in
      the middle of the day did Mr. Kendal allow the womankind to venture out
      without an escort, the evening was disturbed by howlings at the gate, and
      all sorts of petty acts of spite were committed in the garden, such as
      injuring trees, stealing fruit, and carrying off the children&rsquo;s rabbits.
      Let that be as it might, Genevieve owned herself glad to come to
      hospitable Willow Lawn, though sorry for the cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Mr. Rainsforth, after vainly striving to recruit his health at
      Torquay during the vacation, had been sentenced to give up his profession,
      and ordered to Madeira, and Genevieve was upon the world again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Kendals claimed her promise of a long visit, or rather that she should
      come home, and take time and choice in making any fresh engagement, nay,
      that she should not even inquire for a situation till after Christmas. And
      after staying to the last moment when she could help the Rainsforths, she
      proposed to spend a day or two with her aunt at the convent, and then come
      to her friends at Bayford.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kendal drove his ladies to fetch her. He had lately indulged the
      household with a large comfortable open carriage with two horses, a rival
      to Mr. O&rsquo;More&rsquo;s notable car, where he used to drive in an easy lounging
      fashion on one side, with Hyder Ali to balance him on the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a grand shopping day, an endless business, and as the autumn day
      began to close in, even Mr. Kendal&rsquo;s model patience was nearly exhausted
      before they called for their little friend. There was something very sweet
      and appropriate in her appearance; her dress, without presuming to share
      their mourning, did not insult it by gay colouring; it was a quiet dark
      violet and white checked silk, a black mantle, and black velvet bonnet
      with a few green leaves to the lilac flowers, and the face when at rest
      was softly pensive, but ready to respond with cheerful smiles and grateful
      looks. She had become more English, and had dropped much foreign accent
      and idiom, but without losing her characteristic grace and power of
      disembarrassing those to whom she spoke, and in a few moments even Sophy
      had lost all sense of meeting under awkward or melancholy circumstances,
      and was talking eagerly to her dear old sympathizing friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a great exchange of tidings; Genevieve had much to tell of her
      dear Rainsforths, the many vicissitudes of anxiety in which she had
      shared, and of the children&rsquo;s ways of taking the parting; and of the dear
      little Fanny who seemed to have carried away so large a piece of her
      susceptible heart, that Sophy could not help breaking out, &lsquo;Well, I do
      think it is very hard to make yourself a bit of a mother&rsquo;s heart, only to
      have it torn out again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia smiled, and said, &lsquo;After all, Sophy, happiness in this world is in
      such loving, only we don&rsquo;t find it out till the rent has been made.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And some people can get fond of anything,&rsquo; said Sophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure,&rsquo; said Genevieve, &lsquo;every one is so kind to me I can&rsquo;t help it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was not blaming you,&rsquo; said Sophy. &lsquo;People are the better for it, but I
      cannot like except where I esteem, and that does not often come.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! don&rsquo;t you think so?&rsquo; cried Genevieve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t mean moderate approval. That may extend far, and with it
      good-will, but there is a deep, concentrated feeling which I don&rsquo;t believe
      those who like every one can ever have, and that is life.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps the deepening twilight favoured the utterance of her feelings,
      for, as they were descending a hill, she said, &lsquo;Mamma, that was the place
      where Maurice was brought back to me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She had before passed it in silence, but in the dark she was not afraid of
      betraying the expression that the thrill of exquisite recollection brought
      to her countenance; and leaning back in her corner indulged in listening
      to the narration, as Albinia, unaware of the special point of the episode,
      related Maurice&rsquo;s desperate enterprise, going on to dilate on the benefit
      of having Mr. O&rsquo;More at the bank rather than Andrew Goldsmith.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said Genevieve, &lsquo;it is he who wants to pull down our dear old house.
      I shall quarrel with him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Genevieve making common cause with the obstructives of Bayford, as if he
      had not enemies enough!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s that light in the sky?&rsquo; exclaimed Sophy, starting up to speak to
      her father on the driving seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A bonfire,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal. &lsquo;If we had remembered that it was the 5th of
      November, we would not have stayed out so late.&rsquo; The next moment he drew
      up the horses, exclaiming, &lsquo;Mr. Hope, will you have a lift?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hope, rather to the ladies&rsquo; surprise, took the vacant place beside
      Sophy, instead of climbing up to the box. He had been to see his intended
      parish, and was an enviable man, for he was as proud of it as if it had
      been an intended wife, and Albinia, who knew it for a slice of dreary
      heath, was entertained with his raptures. Church, schools, and parsonage,
      each in their way were perfection or at least promised to be, and he had
      never been so much elevated or so communicative. The speechless little
      curate seemed to have vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      The road, as may be remembered, did not run parallel with the curve of the
      river, but cutting straight across, entered Bayford over the hill, passing
      a small open bit of waste land, where stood a few cottages, the outskirts
      of the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly coming from an overshadowed lane upon this common, a glare of
      light flashed on them, showing them each other&rsquo;s faces, and casting the
      shadow of the carriage into full relief. The horses shied violently, and
      they beheld an enormous bonfire raised on a little knoll about twenty
      yards in front of them, surrounded by a dense crowd, making every species
      of hideous noise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kendal checked the horses&rsquo; start, and Mr. Hope sprang to their heads.
      They were young and scarcely trustworthy, their restless movements showed
      alarm, and it was impossible to turn them without both disturbing the
      crowd and giving them a fuller view of the object of their terror. Mr.
      Kendal came down, and reconnoitring for a moment, said, &lsquo;You had better
      get out while we try to lead them round, we will go home by Squash Lane.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then a brilliant glow of white flame, and a tremendous roar of
      applause, put the horses in such an agony, that they would have been too
      much for Mr. Hope, had not Mr. Kendal started to his assistance, and a man
      standing by likewise caught the rein. He was a respectable carpenter who
      lived on the heath, and touching his hat as he recognised them, said,
      &lsquo;Sir, if the ladies would come into my house, and you too, sir. The people
      are going on in an odd sort of way, and Mrs. Kendal would be frightened.
      I&rsquo;ll take care of the carriage.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kendal went to the side of the carriage, and asked the ladies if they
      were alarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O no!&rsquo; answered Albinia, &lsquo;it is great fun;&rsquo; and as the horses fidgeted
      again, &lsquo;it feels like a review.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You had better get out,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;I must try to back the horses till I
      can turn them without running over any one. Will you go into the house?
      You did not expect to find Bayford so riotous,&rsquo; he added with a smile, as
      he assisted Genevieve out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are not going to get up again,&rsquo; said Albinia, catching hold of him,
      and in her dread of his committing himself to the mercy of the horses,
      returning unmeaning thanks to the carpenter&rsquo;s urgent requests that she
      would take refuge in his house.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, the scene was new and entertaining, and on the farther side of
      the road, sheltered by the carriage, the party were entirely apart from
      the throng, which was too much absorbed to notice them, only a few heads
      turning at the rattling of the harness, and the ladies were amused at the
      bright flame, and the dark figures glancing in and out of the light, the
      shouts of delight and the merry faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s Guy Fawkes,&rsquo; cried Albinia, as a procession of scarecrows were
      home on chairs amid thunders of acclamation; &lsquo;but whom have they besides?
      Here are some new characters.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Most lugubrious looking,&rsquo; said Genevieve. &lsquo;I cannot make out the shouts.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is the Nabob,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal. &lsquo;Perhaps you do not know that is my
      alias. This is my execution.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The carpenter implored them to come in, and Mr. Hope added his entreaties,
      but Mr. Kendal would not leave the horses, and the ladies would not leave
      him; and they all stood still while his effigy was paraded round the
      knoll, the mark of every squib, the object of every invective that the
      rabble could roar out at the top of their voices. Jesuits and Papists;
      Englishmen treated like blackamoor slaves in the Indies; honest folk
      driven out of house and home; such was the burthen of the cries that
      assailed the grim representative carried aloft, while the real man stood
      unmoved as a statue, his tall, powerful figure unstirred, his long
      driving-whip resting against his shoulder without betraying the slightest
      motion, neither firm lip nor steady eye changing. Genevieve, with tears in
      her eyes, exclaimed, &lsquo;Oh! this is madness! Will no one tell them how
      wicked they are?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never mind, my dear,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal, pressing the hand that in her
      fervour she had laid on his arm, &lsquo;they will come to their senses in time.
      No, Mr. Hope, I beg you will not interfere, they are in no state for it;
      they have done no harm as yet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wonder what the police are about?&rsquo; cried Albinia, indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They are too few to do any good,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal. &lsquo;It may be better that
      they are not incensing the mob. It will all go off quietly when this
      explosion has relieved their feelings.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They felt as if there were something grand in this perfectly dispassionate
      reception of the outrage, and they stood awed and silenced, Sophy leaning
      on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It will soon be over now,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;they are poking up the name to
      receive me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hark! what&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The mob came swaying back, and a rich voice swelled above all the din,
      &lsquo;Boys, boys, is it burning your friends you are? Then, for the first time,
      Mr. Kendal started, and muttered, &lsquo;foolish lad! is he here?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Confused cries rose again, but the other voice gained the mastery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So you call that undertaker-looking figure there Mr. Kendal. Small credit
      to your taste. You want to burn him. What for?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For being a Nabob and a tyrant,&rsquo; was the shout.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Much you know of Nabobs! No; I&rsquo;ll tell you what it&rsquo;s for. It is because
      his son got his death fighting for his queen and his country a year ago,
      and on his death-bed bade him do his best to drive the fever from your
      doors, and shelter you and save you from the Union in your old age. Is
      that a thing to burn him for?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We want no Irish papists here!&rsquo; shouted a blackguard voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Serve him with the same sauce.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never was a papist,&rsquo; was the indignant reply. &lsquo;No more was he; but I&rsquo;ve
      said that the place shan&rsquo;t disgrace itself, and&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m with you,&rsquo; shouted another above all the howls of the mob. &lsquo;Gilbert
      Kendal was as kind-hearted a chap as ever lived, and I&rsquo;ll see no wrong
      done to his father.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Tremendous uproar ensued; then the well-known tones pealed out again,
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve given my word to save his likeness. Come on, boys. Hurrah for
      Kendal!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The war-cry was echoed by a body of voices, there was a furious melee and
      a charge towards the Nabob, who rocked and toppled down, while stragglers
      came pressed backwards on all sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here, Hope, take care of them. Stay with them,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal, putting
      the whip into the curate&rsquo;s hand, and striding towards the nucleus of the
      fray, through the throng who were driven backwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O&rsquo;More,&rsquo; he called, &lsquo;what&rsquo;s all this? Give over! Are you mad?&rsquo; and then
      catching up, and setting on his legs, a little fallen boy, &lsquo;Go home; get
      out of all this mischief. What are you doing? Take home that child,&rsquo; to a
      gaping girl with a baby. &lsquo;O&rsquo;More, I say, I&rsquo;ll commit every man of you if
      you don&rsquo;t give over.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He was recognised, and those who had little appetite for the skirmish gave
      back from him; but the more reckless and daring small fry began shrieking,
      &lsquo;The Nabob!&rsquo; and letting off crackers and squibs, through which he
      advanced upon the knot of positive combatants, who were exchanging blows
      over his prostrate image in front of the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      One he caught by the collar, in the act of aiming a blow. The fist was
      instantly levelled at him, with the cry, &lsquo;You rascal! what do you mean by
      it?&rsquo; But the fierce struggle failed to shake off the powerful grasp; and
      at the command, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be such a fool!&rsquo; Ulick burst out, &lsquo;Murder! &lsquo;tis
      himself!&rsquo; and in the surprise was dragged some paces before recovering his
      perceptions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cry of police had at the same instant produced a universal scattering,
      and five policemen, coming on the ground, found scarcely any one to
      separate or capture. Mr. Kendal relaxed his hold, saying, &lsquo;You are my
      prisoner.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d been so strong,&rsquo; said Ulick, shaking himself, and
      looking bewildered. &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s the effigy?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s that to you. Come away, like a rational being.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ha! what&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; as a frightful, agonizing shriek rent the air, and a
      pillar of flame came rushing across the now open space. It was a child,
      one mass of fire, and flying, in its anguish, from all who would have
      seized it. One moment of horror, and it had vanished! The next,
      Genevieve&rsquo;s voice was heard crying, &lsquo;Bring me something more to press on
      it.&rsquo; She had contrived to cross its path with her large carriage rug, and
      was kneeling over it, forcing down the rug to smother the flames. Mr. Hope
      brought her a shawl, and they all stood round in silent awe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The poor child will be stifled,&rsquo; said Albinia, kneeling down to help to
      unfold its face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor little face, distorted with terror and agony! One of the policemen
      recognised it as the child of the public-house in Tibb&rsquo;s Alley. There were
      moans, but no one dared to uncover the limbs; and the policeman and Mr.
      Hope proposed carrying it at once to Mr. Bowles, and then home. Mr. Kendal
      desired that it should be laid on the seat of the carriage, which he would
      drive gently to the doctor&rsquo;s. Genevieve got in to watch over the poor
      little boy, and the others walked on by the side, passed the battle-field,
      now entirely deserted, too much shocked for aught but conjectures on his
      injuries, and the cause of the misfortune. Either he must have been pushed
      in on the fire by the runaway rabble, or have trod upon some of the
      scattered combustibles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bowles desired that the child should be taken home at once, promising
      to follow instantly; so at the entrance of Tibb&rsquo;s Alley, the carriage
      stopped, and Mr. Hope lifted out the poor little wailing bundle. Albinia
      was following, but a decided prohibition from her husband checked her. &lsquo;I
      would not have either of you go to that house on any account. Tell them to
      send to us for whatever they want, but that is enough.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no gainsaying such a command, but as they reached the door of
      Willow Lawn, Mr. Kendal exclaimed, &lsquo;Where is Miss Durant?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She is gone with the little boy,&rsquo; said Sophy. &lsquo;She told me she hoped you
      would not be displeased. Mr. Hope will take care of her, and she will soon
      come in.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Every one is mad to-night!&rsquo; cried Mr. Kendal. &lsquo;In such a place as that! I
      will go for her directly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pray don&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said Albinia, &lsquo;no one could speak a rude word to her on such
      an errand. She and Mr. Hope will be much more secure from incivility
      without you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I believe it may be so, but I wish&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His wish was broken off, for his little Albinia, screaming, &lsquo;Papa! papa!&rsquo; 
      clung to him in a transport of caresses, which Maurice explained by
      saying, &lsquo;Little Awkey has been crying, mamma, she thought they were
      burning papa in the bonnie.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Papa not burnt!&rsquo; cried little Awkey, patting his cheeks, and laying her
      head on his shoulders alternately, as he held her to his breast. &lsquo;Naughty
      people wanted to make a fire, but they sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t burn papa or poor Guy
      Fawkes, or any of the good men.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And where were you, Ulick?&rsquo; cried Maurice, in an imperious, injured way.
      &lsquo;You said once, perhaps you would take me to see the fire; and I went up
      to the bank, and they said you were gone, and it was glaring so in the
      sky, and I did so want to go.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am glad you stayed away, my man,&rsquo; said Albinia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I did want to go,&rsquo; said Maurice; &lsquo;and I ran up to the top of the street,
      and there was Mr. Tritton; and he said if I liked a lark, he would take
      care of me; but&mdash;&rsquo; and there he stopped short, and the colour came
      into his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia threw her arm round him, and kissed him, saying, &lsquo;My trusty boy!
      and so you came home?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes; and there was Awkey crying about their burning papa, and she would
      not go up to the garret-window to see the fire, nor do anything.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, what is the sword here for?&rsquo; exclaimed Sophy, finding it on the
      stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because then Awkey was not so afraid.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      For once, Maurice had been exemplary, keeping from the tempting uproar,
      and devoting himself to soothing his little sister. It was worth all the
      vexations of the evening; but he went on to ask if Ulick could not take
      him now, if the fire was not out yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not exactly,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal, drily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I beg your pardon, Mr. Kendal,&rsquo; said Ulick, who had apparently only just
      resumed the use of speech; &lsquo;don&rsquo;t know what I may have done when you
      collared me, but I&rsquo;d no more notion of its being you than the Lord
      Lieutenant.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And pray what took you there?&rsquo; asked Mr. Kendal. &lsquo;The surprise was quite
      as great to me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why,&rsquo; said Ulick, &lsquo;one of the little lads of my Sunday class gave me a
      hint the other day that those brutes meant to have a pretty go to-night,
      and that Jackson was getting up a figure of the Nabob to break their spite
      upon. So I told my little fellow to give a hint to a few more of the right
      sort, and we&rsquo;d go up together and not let the rascals have their own way.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Upon my word, I wonder what the Vicar will say to the use you make of his
      Sunday-school. Pretty work for his model teacher.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What better could the boys be taught than to fight for the good cause?
      Why, no one is a scratch the worse for it. And do you think we could sit
      by and see our best friend used worse than a dog?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why not give notice to the police?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And would you have me hinder a fight?&rsquo; cried Ulick, in the most Irish of
      all his voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! very well, if you like&mdash;only there will be a run on the bank
      to-morrow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What has Ulick been doing, Sophy?&rsquo; asked Maurice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only what you would have done had you been older, Maurice,&rsquo; she said, in
      a hurt voice; &lsquo;defending papa&rsquo;s effigy, for which he does not seem to meet
      with much gratitude.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal, who all the time had had more gratitude in his
      eyes than on his tongue, &lsquo;if the burning had had the same consequence as
      melting one&rsquo;s waxen effigy was thought to have, it might have been worth
      while to interfere, but I should have thought it more dignified in a
      respectable substantial householder to let those foolish fellows have
      their swing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;More dignified maybe,&rsquo; smiled Albinia, &lsquo;but less like an O&rsquo;More.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, you are not going,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal; &lsquo;I shall not release my prisoner
      just yet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You carried off all the honour of the day,&rsquo; said Ulick. &lsquo;I had no notion
      you had such an arm. Why, you swung me round like a tom-cat, or&mdash;&rsquo; 
      and he exemplified the exploit upon Maurice, and was well buffeted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s a little Irish blarney to propitiate me,&rsquo; laughed Mr. Kendal, who
      certainly was in unusual spirits after his execution and rescue by proxy,
      but you wont escape prison fare.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s no doubt who was the heroine of the day,&rsquo; added Sophy. &lsquo;How one
      envies her!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What! your little governess friend?&rsquo; said Ulick. &lsquo;Yes; she did show
      superior wit, when the rest of the world stood gaping round.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was admirable&mdash;just like Genevieve&rsquo;s tenderness and dexterity,&rsquo; 
      said Albinia. &lsquo;I dare say she is doing everything for the poor little
      fellow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, admirable,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal; &lsquo;but you all behaved very creditably,
      ladies.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ay,&rsquo; said Albinia; &lsquo;not to scream is what a man thinks the climax of
      excellence in a woman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is generally all that is required,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal. I don&rsquo;t know what
      I should have done if poor Lucy had been there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon the ladies went upstairs, Maurice following Sophy to extract a
      full account of the skirmish. The imp probably had an instinct that she
      would think more of what redounded to Ulick O&rsquo;More&rsquo;s glory than of what
      would be edifying to his own infant mind. It was doubtful how long it
      would be before Guy Fawkes would arrive at his proper standing in the
      little Awk&rsquo;s opinion, after the honour of an auto-da-fe in company with
      papa.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hope escorted Genevieve home, and was kept to dinner. They narrated
      that they had found the public-house open, and the bar full of noisy
      runaways.
    </p>
    <p>
      The burns were dreadful, but the surgeon did not think they would be
      fatal, and the child had held Genevieve&rsquo;s hand throughout the dressing,
      and seemed so unwilling to part with her, that she had promised to come
      again the next day, and had been thanked gratefully. There seemed no
      positive want of comforts, and there was every hope that all would do
      well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Genevieve looked pale after the scene she had gone through, and could not
      readily persuade herself to eat, still less rally her spirits to talk; but
      she managed to avoid observation at dinner-time, and afterwards a rest on
      the sofa restored her. She evidently felt, as she said, that this was
      coming home, and her exquisite gift of tact making her perceive that she
      was to be at ease and on an equality, she assumed her position without
      giving her friends the embarrassment of installing her, and Mr. Hope was
      in such a state of transparent admiration, that Albinia could not help two
      or three times noiselessly clapping her hands under the table, and
      secretly thanking the rioters and their tag-rag and bob-tail for having
      provided a home for little Genevieve Durant.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was indeed a pang as she thought of Gilbert; but she believed that
      Genevieve&rsquo;s heart had never been really touched, and was still fresh and
      open. She thought she might make Mr. Kendal and Sophy equally magnanimous.
      Perhaps by that time Sophy would be too happy to have leisure to be hurt,
      and she had little fear but that Mr. Kendal&rsquo;s good sense would conquer his
      jealousy for his son, though it might cost him something.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two lovers to befriend at once! Two desirable attachments to foster! There
      was glory! Not that Albinia fulfilled her mission to a great extent;
      shamefacedness always restrained her, and she had not Emily&rsquo;s gift for
      making opportunities. Indeed, when she did her best, so perversely bashful
      were the parties, that the wrong pairs resorted together, the two who
      could talk being driven into conversation by the silence of the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of Mr. Hope&rsquo;s sentiments there could be no doubt. He was fairly carried
      off his feet by the absorption of the passion, which was doubly engrossing
      because all ladies had hitherto appeared to him as beings with whom
      conversation was an impossible duty; but after all he had heard of Miss
      Durant, he might as a judicious man select her for an excellent parsoness,
      and as a young man fall vehemently in love. Nothing could be more evident
      to the lookers-on, but Albinia could not satisfy herself whether Genevieve
      had any suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was not very young, knew something of the world, and was acute and
      observing; but on the other hand, she had made it a principle never to
      admit the thought of courtship, and she might not be sufficiently
      acquainted with the habits of the individual to be sensible of the
      symptomatic alteration.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had begged the Dusautoys to make her leisure profitable, and spent
      much of her time upon the schools, on her little patient in Tibb&rsquo;s Alley,
      and in going about among the poor; she visited her old shopkeeper friends,
      and drank tea with them much oftener than gratified Mr. Kendal, talking so
      openly of the pleasure of seeing them again, that Albinia sometimes
      thought the blood of the O&rsquo;Mores was a little chafed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There,&rsquo; said Genevieve, completing a housewife, filled with needles ready
      threaded, &lsquo;I wonder whether the omnibus is too protestant to leave a
      parcel at the convent?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think its scruples of conscience would withstand sixpence,&rsquo; said
      Albinia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You might post it for less than that,&rsquo; said Sophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you know,&rsquo; said Ulick O&rsquo;More, who was playing with the little Awk
      in the window, &lsquo;that the feminine mind loves expedients? It would be less
      commonplace to confide the parcel to the conductor, than merely let him
      receive it as guard of the mail bag and servant of the public.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Exactly,&rsquo; laughed Genevieve. &lsquo;Think of the moral influence of being
      selected as bearer of a token of tenderness to my aunt on her fete,
      instead of being treated as a mere machine, devoid of human sympathies.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sophy, where were we reading of a nation which gives the simplest
      transaction the air of a little romance?&rsquo; said Ulick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I have heard of a nation which denudes every action of sentiment, and
      leaves you the tree without the leaves,&rsquo; was Genevieve&rsquo;s retort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That misses fire, Miss Durant; my nation does everything by the soul,
      nothing by mechanism.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When they <i>do</i> do it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s a defiance. You must deprive the conductor of the moral influence,
      whether as man or machine, and entrust the parcel to me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That would be like chartering a steamer to send home a Chinese puzzle.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, indeed; I must go to Hadminster. Bear me witness, Sophy, Miss
      Goldsmith wants me to talk to the house agent.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mind, if you miss St. Leocadia&rsquo;s day, you will miss my aunt&rsquo;s fete.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. O&rsquo;More succeeded in carrying off the little parcel. The next morning,
      as the ladies were descending the hill, a hurried step came after them,
      and the curate said in an abrupt rapid manner, &lsquo;I beg your pardon, I was
      going to Hadminster; could I do anything for you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing, thank you,&rsquo; said Albinia, at whom he looked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did I not hear&mdash;Miss Durant had some work to send her aunt to-day?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How did you know that, Mr. Hope?&rsquo; exclaimed Genevieve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I heard something pass, when some one was admiring your work,&rsquo; he said,
      not looking at her. &lsquo;And this&mdash;I think&mdash;is St. Leocadia&rsquo;s day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am very much obliged to you for remembering it, but I have sent my
      little parcel otherwise, so I need not trouble you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! how stupid in me! I am very sorry. I beg your pardon,&rsquo; and he hurried
      off, looking as if very sorry were not a mere matter of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor man,&rsquo; thought Albinia, &lsquo;I dare say he has reckoned on it all this
      time, and hunted out St. Leocadia in Alban Butler, and then tried to screw
      up his courage all yesterday. Ulick has managed to traverse a romance, but
      perhaps it is just as well, for what would be the effect on the public of
      Mr. Hope in <i>that</i> coat being seen ringing at the convent door?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, Miss Durant,&rsquo; said Ulick, entering the drawing-room in the winter
      twilight, &lsquo;here is evidence for you!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have actually penetrated the convent, and seen my aunt? Impossible!
      and yet this pencilled note is her own dear writing!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t mean that you really were let in?&rsquo; cried Sophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I entered quite legitimately, I assure you. It was all luck. I&rsquo;d just
      been putting up at the Crown, when what should I see in a sort of a
      trance, staring right into the inn-yard, but as jolly-looking a priest as
      ever held a station. &ldquo;An&rsquo; it&rsquo;s long since I&rsquo;ve seen the like of you,&rdquo; says
      he aloud to himself. &ldquo;Is it the car?&rdquo; says I. &ldquo;Sure it is,&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
      not laid my eyes on so iligant a vehicle since I left County Tyrone.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. O&rsquo;Hara!&rsquo; exclaimed Genevieve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m mistaken if you&rsquo;re not the master of it,&rdquo; he goes on, taking the
      measure of me all over,&rsquo; continued Ulick, putting on his drollest brogue.
      &lsquo;You see he had too much manners to say that such a personable young
      gentleman, speaking such correct English, could be no other than an
      Irishman, so I made my bow, and said the car and I were both from County
      Galway, and we were straight as good friends as if we&rsquo;d hunted together at
      Ballymakilty. To be sure, he was a little taken aback when he found I was
      one of the Protestant branch, of the O&rsquo;Mores, but a countryman is a
      countryman in a barbarous land, and he asked me to call upon him, and
      offered to do me any service in his power.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am sure he would. He is the kindest old gentleman I know,&rsquo; exclaimed
      Genevieve. &lsquo;He always used to bring me barleysugar-drops when I was a
      little girl, and it was he who found out our poor old Biddy in distress at
      Hadminster, and sent her to live with us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed! Then I owe him another debt of gratitude&mdash;in fact, he told
      me that one of his flock, meaning Biddy, had spoken to him honourably of
      me. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;the greatest service you could do me, sir, would be
      to introduce me to Mademoiselle Belmarche; I have a young lady&rsquo;s
      commission for her.&rdquo; &ldquo;From my little Genevieve,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the darling
      that she is. Did you leave the child well?&rdquo; And so when I said it was a
      present for her saint&rsquo;s day, and that your heart was set on it&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But, Mr. O&rsquo;More, I never did set my heart on your seeing her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, well, you would have done it if you&rsquo;d known there had been any
      chance of it, besides, your heart was set on her getting the work, and how
      could I make sure of that unless I gave it into her own hand? I wouldn&rsquo;t
      have put it into Mr. O&rsquo;Hara&rsquo;s snuffy pocket to hinder myself from being
      bankrupt.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then he took you in?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So he did, like an honest Irishman as he was. He rang at the bell and
      spoke to the portress, and had me into the parlour and sent up for the
      lady; and I have seldom spent a pleasanter hall-hour. Mademoiselle
      Belmarche bade me tell you that she would write fuller thanks to you
      another day, and that her eyes would thank you every night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Was her cold gone? Did she seem well, the dear aunt?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Genevieve was really grateful, and had many questions to ask about her
      aunt, which met with detailed answers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By-the-by,&rsquo; said Ulick,&rsquo; I met Mr. Hope in the street as I was coming
      away, I offered him a lift, but he said he was not coming home till late.
      I wonder what he is doing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia and Sophy exchanged glances, and had almost said, &lsquo;Poor Mr. Hope!&rsquo; 
      It was very hard that the good fortune and mere good nature of an
      indifferent person should push him where the quiet curate so much wished
      to be. Albinia would have liked to have had either a little impudence or a
      little tact to enable her to give a hint to Ulick to be less officious.

      St. Leocadia&rsquo;s feast was the 9th of December. Three days after, Genevieve
      received a letter which made her change countenance, and hurry to her own
      room, whence she did not emerge till luncheon-time.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the late afternoon, there was a knock at the drawing-room door, and Mr.
      Dusautoy said, &lsquo;Can I speak with you a minute, Mrs. Kendal?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Dreading ill news of Lucy, she hurried to the morning-room with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fanny said I had better speak to you. This poor fellow is in a dreadful
      state.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Algernon!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, indeed. Poor Hope! What has possessed the girl?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Genevieve has not refused him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did you not know it? I found him in his rooms as white as a sheet! I
      asked what was the matter, he begged me to let him go away for one Sunday,
      and find him a substitute. I saw how it was, and at the first word he
      broke down and told me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Was this to-day?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. What can the silly little puss be thinking of to put an excellent
      fellow like that to so much pain? Going about it in such an admirable way,
      too, writing to old Mamselle first, and getting a letter from her which he
      sends with his own, and promising to guarantee her fifty pounds a year out
      of his own pocket. &lsquo;I should like to know what that little Jenny means by
      it. I gave her credit for more sense.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps she thinks, under the circumstances of her coming here, within
      the year&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! very proper, very pretty of her; I never thought of that; I suppose I
      have your permission to tell Hope?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I believe all the town knew it,&rsquo; said Albinia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes; he need not be downhearted, he has only to be patient, and he will
      like her the better for it. After all, though he is as good a man as
      breathes, he cannot be Gilbert, and it will be a great relief to him. I&rsquo;ll
      tell him to put all his fancies about O&rsquo;More out of his head.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Most decidedly,&rsquo; said Albinia; &lsquo;nothing can be greater nonsense. Tell him
      by no means to go away, for when she finds that our feelings are not hurt,
      and has become used to the idea, I have every hope that she will be able
      to form a new&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ay; ay; poor Gilbert would have wished it himself. It is very good of
      you, Mrs. Kendal; I&rsquo;ll put the poor fellow in spirits again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did you hear whether she gave any reasons?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;something about her birth and station; but that&rsquo;s
      stuff&mdash;she&rsquo;s a perfect lady, and much more.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And he is only a bookseller&rsquo;s son.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;True, and though it might be awkward to have the parson&rsquo;s father-in-law
      cutting capers if he lived in the same town, yet being dead these fifteen
      or eighteen years, where&rsquo;s the damage?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Was that all?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I fancy that she said she never meant to marry, but that&rsquo;s all nonsense;
      she is the very girl that ought, and I hope you will talk to her and bring
      her to reason. There&rsquo;s not a couple in the whole place that I should be so
      glad to marry as those two.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia endeavoured to discuss the matter with Genevieve that night when
      they went upstairs. It was not easy to do, for Genevieve seemed resolved
      to wish her good-night outside her door, but she made her entrance, and
      putting her arm round her little friend&rsquo;s waist, said, &lsquo;Am I very much in
      your way, my dear? I thought you might want a little help, or at least a
      little talk.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! Mrs. Kendal, I hoped you did not know!&rsquo; and her eyes filled with
      tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dusautoy told me, my dear; poor Mr. Hope&rsquo;s distress betrayed him, and
      Mr. Dusautoy was anxious I should&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Genevieve did not let her finish, but exclaiming, &lsquo;I did not expect this
      from you, madame,&rsquo; gave way to a shower of tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear child, do we not all feel you the more one with ourselves for
      this reluctance?&rsquo; said Albinia, caressing her fondly. &lsquo;It shall not be
      forced upon you any more till you can bear it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&rsquo;Till!&rsquo; exclaimed Genevieve, alarmed. &lsquo;Oh! do not say that! Do not hold
      out false hopes! I never shall!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do not think you are a fair judge as yet, my dear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think I am,&rsquo; said Genevieve, slowly, &lsquo;I must not let you love me on
      false pretences, dearest Mrs. Kendal. I do not think it is all for&mdash;for
      his sake&mdash;but indeed, though I must esteem Mr. Hope, I do not believe
      I could ever feel for him as&mdash;&rsquo; then breaking off. &lsquo;I pray you, with
      all my heart, dearest friend, never to speak to me of marriage. I am the
      little governess, and while Heaven gives me strength to work for my aunt,
      and you let me call this my home, I am content, I am blessed. Oh! do not
      disturb and unsettle me!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So imploringly did she speak, that she obliterated all thought of the
      prudent arguments with which Albinia had come stored. It was no time for
      them; there was no possibility of endeavouring to dethrone the memory of
      her own Gilbert, and her impulse was far more to agree that no one else
      could ever be loved, than to argue in favour of a new attachment. She was
      proud of Gilbert for being thus recollected, and doubly pleased with the
      widowed heart; nor was it till the first effect of Genevieve&rsquo;s tears had
      passed off that she began to reflect that the idea might become familiar,
      and that romance having been abundantly satisfied by the constancy of the
      Lancer, sober esteem might be the basis of very happy married affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hope did not go away, but he shrank into himself, and grew more timid
      than ever, and it was through the Dusautoys that Albinia learnt that he
      was much consoled, and intended to wait patiently. He had written to
      Mdlle. Belmarche, who had been extremely disappointed, and continued to
      believe that so excellent and well brought up a young girl as her niece
      would not resist her wishes with regard to a young pastor so respectable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy, when made aware of what was going on, did not smile or shed a tear,
      only a strange whiteness came across her face. She made a commonplace
      remark with visible effort, nor was she quite herself for some time. It
      was as if the reference to her brother had stirred up the old wound.
      Genevieve seemed to have been impelled to manifest her determination of
      resuming her occupation, she wrote letters vigorously, answered
      advertisements, and in spite of the united protest of her friends,
      advertised herself as a young person of French extraction, but a member of
      the Church of England, accustomed to tuition, and competent to instruct in
      French, Italian, music, and all the ordinary branches of education.

      CHAPTER XXX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Miss Goldsmith went to spend Christmas with an old friend, leaving Ulick
      more liberty than he had enjoyed for a long time. He used it a good deal
      at Willow Lawn, and was there of course on Christmas-day. After dinner the
      decoration of the church was under discussion. The Bayford neighbourhood
      was unpropitious to holly, and Sophy and Genevieve had hardly ever seen
      any, except that Genevieve remembered the sooty bits sold in London.
      Something passed about sending for a specimen from Fairmead, but Albinia
      said that would not answer, for her brother&rsquo;s children were in despair at
      the absence of berries, and had ransacked Colonel Bury&rsquo;s plantations in
      vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day, about twilight, Albinia and Sophy were arranging some
      Christmas gifts for the old women, in the morning-room; Genevieve was to
      come and help them on her return from the child in Tibb&rsquo;s Alley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, here she comes, up the garden,&rsquo; said Sophy, who was by the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Albinia heard a strange sound as of tightened breath, and
      looking up saw Sophy deathly pale, with her eyes fixed on the window. In
      terror she flew to her side, but Sophy spoke not, she only clutched her
      hand with fingers cold and tight as iron, and gazed with dilated eyes.
      Albinia looked&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ulick had come from the house&mdash;there was a scarlet-berried spray in
      Genevieve&rsquo;s hand, which she was trying to make him take again&mdash;his
      face was all pleading and imploring&mdash;she turned hastily from him, and
      they saw her cheek glowing with crimson&mdash;she tried to force back the
      holly spray&mdash;but her hand was caught&mdash;he was kissing it. No, she
      had rent it away&mdash;she had fled in through the conservatory&mdash;they
      heard the doors&mdash;she had rushed up to her own room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy&rsquo;s grasp grew more rigid&mdash;she panted for breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My child! my child!&rsquo; said Albinia, throwing her arms round her, expecting
      her to faint. &lsquo;Oh! could I have imagined such treason?&rsquo; Her eyes flashed,
      and her frame quivered with indignation. &lsquo;He shall never come into this
      house again!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mamma! hush!&rsquo; said Sophy, releasing herself from her embrace, and keeping
      her body upright, though obliged to seat herself on the nearest chair. &lsquo;It
      is not treason,&rsquo; she said slowly, as though her mouth were parched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Contemptible fickleness!&rsquo; burst out Albinia, but Sophy implored silence
      by a gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;it was a dream, a degrading, humiliating dream; but it is
      over.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is no degradation except to the base trifler I once thought better
      things of.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He has not trifled,&rsquo; said Sophy. &lsquo;Wait! hush!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a composure about her that awed Albinia, who stood watching in
      suspense while she went to the bed-room, drank some water, cooled her
      brow, pushed back her hair, and sitting down again in the same collected
      manner, which gave her almost a look of majesty, she said, &lsquo;Promise me,
      mamma, that all shall go on as if this folly had never crossed our minds.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t! I can&rsquo;t, Sophy!&rsquo; said Albinia in the greatest agitation. &lsquo;I
      can&rsquo;t <i>unknow</i> that you have been shamefully used.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you will lead papa to break his promise to Genevieve, and lower me
      not only in my own eyes, but in those of every one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He little knew that he was bringing her here to destroy his daughter&rsquo;s
      happiness. So that was why she held off from Mr. Hope,&rsquo; cried Albinia,
      burning with such indignation, that on some one she must expend it, but a
      tirade against the artfulness of the little French witch was cut off short
      by an authoritative&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t, mamma! You are unjust! How can she help being loveable!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He had no business to know whether she was or not.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are wrong, mamma. The absurdity was in thinking I ever was so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very little absurd,&rsquo; said Albinia, twining her arms round Sophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t make me silly,&rsquo; hastily said Sophy, her voice trembling for a
      moment; &lsquo;I want to tell you all about it, and you will see that no one is
      to blame. The perception has been growing on me for a long time, but I was
      weak enough to indulge in the dream. It was very sweet!&rsquo; There again she
      struggled not to break down, gained the victory, and went on, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t
      think I should have dared to imagine it myself, but I saw others thought
      it, who knew more; I knew the incredible was sometimes true, and every
      little kindness he did&mdash;Oh! how foolish! as if he could help doing
      kindnesses! My better sense told me he did not really distinguish me; but
      there was something that <i>would</i> feed upon every word and look. Then
      last year I was wakened by the caricature business. That opened my eyes,
      for no one who had <i>that</i> in him would have turned my sister into
      derision. I was sullen then and proud, and when&mdash;when humanity and
      compassion brought him to me in my distress&mdash;oh! why&mdash;why could
      not I have been reasonable, and not have selfishly fed on what I thought
      was revived?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He had no right&mdash;&rsquo; began Albinia, fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He could neither help saving Maurice, nor speaking comfort and support
      when he found me exhausted and sinking. It was I who was the foolish
      creature&mdash;I hate myself! Well, you know how it has been&mdash;I liked
      to believe it was <i>the thing</i>&mdash;I knew he cared less for me than&mdash;but
      I thought it was always so between men and women, and that I would not
      have petty distrusts. But when she came, I saw what the true&mdash;true
      feeling is&mdash;I saw that he felt when she came into the room&mdash;I
      saw how he heard her words and missed mine&mdash;I saw&mdash;&rsquo; Sophy
      collected herself, and spoke quietly and distinctly, &lsquo;I saw his love, and
      that it had never been for me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause; Albinia could not bear to look, speak, or move. Sophy&rsquo;s
      words carried conviction that swept away her sand castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, mamma,&rsquo; said Sophy, earnestly, &lsquo;you own that he has not been false
      or fickle.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If he has not, he has disregarded the choicest jewel that lay in his
      way,&rsquo; said Albinia with some sharpness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But he has not been that,&rsquo; persisted Sophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well&mdash;no; I suppose not.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And no one can be less to blame than Genevieve.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Little flirt, I&rsquo;ve no patience with her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She can&rsquo;t help her manners,&rsquo; repeated Sophy, &lsquo;I feel them so much more
      charming than mine every moment. She will make him so happy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What are you talking of, Sophy? He must be mad if he is in earnest. A man
      of his family pride! His father will never listen to it for a moment.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what his father may do,&rsquo; said Sophy; &lsquo;but I know what I pray
      and entreat we may do, and that is, do our utmost to make this come to
      good.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sophy, don&rsquo;t ask it. I could not, I know you could not.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is no loss of esteem. I honour him as I always did,&rsquo; said Sophy.
      &lsquo;Yes, the more since I see it was all for papa and the right, all
      unselfish, on that 5th of November. Some day I shall have worn out the
      selfishness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She kept her hand tightly pressed on her heart as she spoke, and Albinia
      exclaimed, &lsquo;You shall not see it; you overrate your strength; it is my
      business to prevent you!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Think, mamma,&rsquo; said Sophy, rising in her earnestness. &lsquo;Here is a homeless
      orphan, whom you have taught to love you, whom papa has brought here as to
      a home, and for Gilbert&rsquo;s sake. Is it fair&mdash;innocent, exemplary as
      she is&mdash;to turn against her because she is engaging and I am not, to
      cut her off from us, drive her away to the first situation that offers, be
      it what it may, and with that thought aching and throbbing in her heart?
      Oh, mamma! would that be mercy or justice?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are not asking to have it encouraged in the very house with you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do not see how else it is to be,&rsquo; said Sophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let him go after her, if there&rsquo;s anything in it but Irish folly and
      French coquetry&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How, mamma? Where? When she is a governess in some strange place? How
      could he leave his business? How could she attend to him? Oh, mamma! you
      used to be kind: how can you wish to put two people you love so much to
      such misery?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because I can&rsquo;t put one whom I love better than both, and who deserves
      it, to greater misery,&rsquo; said Albinia, embracing her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then do not put me to the misery of being ungenerous, and the shame of
      having my folly suspected.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia would have argued still, but the children came in, Sophy went
      away, and there was no possibility of a tete-a-tete. How strange it was to
      have such a tumult of feeling within, and know that the same must be
      tenfold multiplied in the hearts of those two girls, and yet go through
      all the domestic conventionalities, each wearing a mask of commonplace
      ease, as though nothing had happened!
    </p>
    <p>
      Genevieve had, Albinia suspected, been crying excessively; for there was
      that effaced annihilated appearance that tears produced on her, but
      otherwise she did her part in answering her host, who was very fond of
      her, and always made her an object of attention. Albinia found herself
      betraying more abstraction, she was so anxiously watching Sophy, who
      acquitted herself best of all, had kept tears from her eyes, talked more
      than usual, and looked brilliant, with a bright colour dyeing her cheeks.
      She was evidently sustained by eagerness to obtain her generous purpose,
      and did not yet realize the price.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spray of holly was lying as if it had been tossed in vexation upon the
      marble slab in the hall. Albinia, from the stairs, saw Sophy take it up,
      and waited to see what she would do with it. The Sophy she had once known
      would have dashed it into the flames, and then have repented. No! Sophy
      held it tenderly, and looked at the glossy leaves and coral fruit with no
      angry eye; she even raised it to her lips, but it was to pierce with one
      of the long prickles till her brow drew together at the smart, and the
      blood started. Then she began to mount the stairs, and meeting Albinia,
      said quietly, &lsquo;I was going to take this to Genevieve&rsquo;s room, it is empty
      now, but perhaps you had better take care of it for her, out of sight. It
      will be her greatest treasure to-morrow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kendal read aloud as usual, but who of his audience attended?
      Certainly not Albinia. She sat with her head bent over her work, revolving
      the history of these last two years, and trying to collect herself after
      the sudden shock, and the angry feelings of disappointment that surged
      within, in much need of an object of wrath. Alas! who could that object be
      but that blind, warm-hearted, impulsive Mistress Albinia Kendal?
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw plain enough, now it was too late, that there had not been a
      shadow of sentiment in that lively confiding Irishman, used to intimacy
      with a herd of cousins, and viewing all connexions as cousins. She
      remembered his conversation with her brother and her brother&rsquo;s impression;
      she thought of the unloverlike dread of ague in Emily&rsquo;s moonlight walk;
      she recalled the many occasions when she had thought him remiss, and she
      could not but acquit him of any designed flirtation, any dangerous
      tenderness, or what Mdlle. Belmarche would call legerete. He could not be
      reserved&mdash;he was naturally free and open&mdash;and how could she have
      put such a construction on his frankness, when Sophy herself had long been
      gradually arriving at a conviction of the truth! It was a comfort at least
      to remember that it had not been the fabrication of her own brain, she had
      respectable authority for the idea, and she trusted to its prompter to
      participate in her indignation, argue Ulick out of so poor a match, and at
      least put a decided veto upon Sophy&rsquo;s Spartan magnanimity&mdash;Sophy&rsquo;s
      health and feelings being the subject, she sometimes thought, which
      concerned him above all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah! but the evil had not been his doing. He had but gossiped out a
      pleasant conjecture to his wife as a trustworthy help-meet. What business
      had she to go and telegraph that conjecture, with her significant eyes, to
      the very last person who ought to have shared it, and then to have kept up
      the mischief by believing it herself, and acting, looking, and arranging,
      as on a certainty implied, though not expressed? Mrs. Osborne or Mrs.
      Drury might have spoken more broadly, they could not have acted worse,
      thought she to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The notion might never have been suggested; Sophy might have simply
      enjoyed these years of intimacy, and even if her heart had been touched,
      it would have been unconsciously, and the pain and shame of unrequited
      affection have merely been a slight sense of neglect, a small dreariness,
      lost in eagerness for the happiness of both friends. Now, two years of
      love that she had been allowed to imagine returned and sanctioned, and
      love with the depth and force of Sophy&rsquo;s whole nature&mdash;the shame of
      having loved unasked, the misery of having lived in a delusion&mdash;how
      would they act upon a being of her morbid tendency, frail constitution,
      and proud spirit? As Albinia thought of the passive endurance of last
      year&rsquo;s estrangement, her heart sank within her! Illness&mdash;brain-fever&mdash;permanent
      ill-health and crushed spirits&mdash;nay, death itself she augured&mdash;and
      all&mdash;all her own fault! The last and best of Edmund&rsquo;s children so
      cruelly and deeply wounded, and by her folly! She longed to throw herself
      at his feet and ask his pardon, but it was Sophy&rsquo;s secret as well as hers,
      and how could womanhood betray that unrequited love? At least she thought,
      for noble Sophy&rsquo;s sake, she would not raise a finger to hinder the
      marriage, but as to forwarding it, or promoting the courtship under
      Sophy&rsquo;s very eyes&mdash;that would be like murdering her outright, and she
      would join Mr. Kendal with all her might in removing their daughter from
      the trying spectacle. Talk of Aunt Maria! This trouble was ten thousand
      times worse!
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia began to watch the timepiece, longing to have the evening over,
      that she might prepare Mr. Kendal. It ended at last, and Genevieve took up
      her candle, bade good-night, and disappeared. Sophy lingered, till coming
      forward to her father as he stood by the fire, she said, &lsquo;Papa, did you
      not promise Gilbert that Genevieve should be as another daughter?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish she would be, my dear,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal; &lsquo;but she is too
      independent, and your mamma thinks she would consider it as a mere farce
      to call her little Albinia&rsquo;s governess, but if you can persuade her&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What I want you to do, papa, is to promise that she shall be married from
      this house, as her home, and that you will fit her out as you did Lucy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ha! Is she beginning to relent?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, papa. It will be Ulick O&rsquo;More.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t mean it!&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Kendal, more taken by surprise than
      perhaps he had ever been, and looking at his wife, who was standing
      dismayed, yet admiring the gallant girl who had forestalled her
      precautions. Obliged to speak, she said, &lsquo;I am afraid so, Sophy and I
      witnessed a scene to-day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Afraid?&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal; &lsquo;I see no reason to be afraid, if Ulick likes
      it. They are two of the most agreeable and best people that ever fell in
      my way, and I shall be delighted if they can arrange it, for they are
      perfectly suited to each other.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But such a match!&rsquo; exclaimed Albinia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As to that, a sensible, economical wife will be worth more to him than an
      expensive one, with however large a fortune. And for the family pride, I
      am glad the lad has more sense than I feared; he has a full right to
      please himself, having won the place he has, and he may make his father
      consent. He wants a wife&mdash;nothing else will keep him from running
      headlong into speculation, for want of something to do. Yes, I see what
      you are thinking of, my dear, but you know we could not wish her, as you
      said yourself, never to form another attachment.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But <i>here</i>!&rsquo; sighed Albinia, the ground knocked away from under her,
      yet still clinging to the last possible form of murmur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It will cost us something,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal, &lsquo;but no more than we will
      cheerfully bear, for the sake of one who has such claims upon us; and it
      will be amply repaid by having such a pair of friends settled close to
      us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you will, papa?&rsquo; said Sophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will do what, my dear?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Treat her as&mdash;as you did Lucy, papa.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And with much more pleasure, and far more hope, than when we fitted out
      poor Lucy,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy thanked him, and said &lsquo;Good-night;&rsquo; and the look which accompanied
      her kiss to her step-mother was a binding over to secrecy and
      non-interference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is she gone?&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal, who had been musing after his last words.
      &lsquo;Gone to tell her friend, I suppose? I wanted to ask what this scene was.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; said Albinia, &lsquo;it was in the garden&mdash;we saw it from the window&mdash;only
      he brought her a bit of holly, and was trying to kiss her hand.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Strong premises, certainly. How did she receive the advance?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She would not listen, but made her escape.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then matters are not in such a state of progress as for me to
      congratulate her? I suppose that you ladies are the best judges whether he
      may not meet with the same fate as poor Hope?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sophy seems to take it for granted that he will not.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Irishman as he is, he must be pretty secure of his ground before coming
      to such strong measures. Well! I hope we may hear no more of brow-ague.
      But&mdash;&rsquo; with sudden recollection&mdash;&lsquo;I thought, Albinia, you
      fancied he had some inclination for Sophy?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it not a good wife to suppress the &lsquo;You did&rsquo;? If she could merrily
      have said, &lsquo;You told me so,&rsquo; it would have been all very well, but her
      mood would admit of nothing but a grave and guarded answer&mdash;&lsquo;We did
      fancy so, but I am convinced it was entirely without reason.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      That superior smile at her lively imagination was more than human nature
      could bear, without the poor relief of an entreaty that he would not sit
      meditating, and go to sleep in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia thought she had recovered equanimity during her night&rsquo;s rest, but
      in the midst of her morning toilette, Sophy hurried in, exclaiming,
      &lsquo;She&rsquo;ll go away! She is writing letters and packing!&rsquo; and she answered,
      &lsquo;Well, what do you want me to do? You don&rsquo;t imagine that I can rush into
      her room and lay hands on her? She will not go upon a wishing-carpet. It
      will be time to interfere when we know more of the matter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy looked blank, and vanished, and Albinia felt excessively vexed at
      having visited on the chief sufferer her universal crossness with all
      mankind. She knew she had only spoken common sense, but that made it
      doubly hateful; and yet she could not but wish Miss Durant anywhere out of
      sight, and Mr. O&rsquo;More on the top of the Hill of Howth.
    </p>
    <p>
      At breakfast, Sophy&rsquo;s looks betrayed nothing to the uninitiated, though
      Albinia detected a feverish restlessness and covert impatience, and judged
      that her sleep had been little. Genevieve&rsquo;s had perhaps been less, for she
      was very sallow, with sunken eyes, and her face looked half its usual
      size; but Albinia could not easily have compassion on the poor little
      unwitting traitress, even when she began, &lsquo;Dear Mrs. Kendal, will you
      excuse me if I take a sudden leave? I find it will answer best for me to
      accept Mrs. Elwood&rsquo;s invitation; I can then present myself to any lady who
      may wish to see me, and, as I promised my aunt another visit, I had better
      go to Hadminster by the three o&rsquo;clock omnibus.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia was thankful for the loud opposition which drowned the faint
      reluctance of her own; Mr. Kendal insisting that she should not leave
      them; little Awk coaxing her; and Maurice exclaiming, &lsquo;If the ladies want
      her, let them come after her! One always goes to see a horse.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not so well worth the trouble, Maurice.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know Ulick O&rsquo;More <i>would</i> come in to see you when all the piebalds
      for the show were going by!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Some day you will come to the same good taste,&rsquo; said his father, to
      lessen the general confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;See a lady instead of a piebald? Never!&rsquo; cried Maurice with indignation,
      that made the most preoccupied laugh; under cover of which Genevieve
      effected a retreat. Sophy looked imploringly at Albinia&mdash;Albinia was
      moving, but not with alacrity, and Mr. Kendal was saying, &lsquo;I do not
      understand all this,&rsquo; when, scarcely pausing to knock, Ulick opened the
      door, cheeks and eyes betraying scarcely repressed eagerness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&mdash;where,&rsquo; he stammered, as if even his words were startled away;
      &lsquo;is not Miss Durant well?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She was here just this moment,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will go and see for her,&rsquo; said Sophy. &lsquo;Come, children.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether Sophy&rsquo;s powers over herself or over Genevieve would avail, was an
      anxious marvel, but it did not last a moment, for Maurice came clattering
      down to say that Genevieve was gone out into the town. In such a moment!
      She must have snatched up her bonnet, and fled one way while Ulick entered
      by the other. He made one step forward, exclaiming, &lsquo;Where is she gone?&rsquo; 
      then pausing, broke out, &lsquo;Mrs. Kendal, you must make her give me a
      hearing, or I shall go mad!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A hearing?&rsquo; repeated Mrs. Kendal, with slight malice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes; why, don&rsquo;t you know?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So your time has come, Ulick, has it?&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, and I were worse than an old ledger if it had not, when she was
      before me! Make her listen to me, Mrs. Kendal, if she do not, I shall
      never do any more good in this world!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should have thought,&rsquo; said Albinia, &lsquo;that an Irishman would be at no
      loss for making opportunities.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t know, Mrs. Kendal; she is so fenced in with scruples, humility&mdash;I
      know not what&mdash;that she will not so much as hear me out. I&rsquo;m not such
      a blockhead as to think myself worthy of her, but I do think, if she would
      only listen to me, I might stand a chance: and she runs off, as if she
      thought it a sin to hear a word from my mouth!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is very honourable to her,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very honourable to her,&rsquo; replied Ulick, &lsquo;but cruelly hard upon me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think, too,&rsquo; continued Mr. Kendal, stimulated thereto by his lady&rsquo;s
      severely prudent looks, &lsquo;that you ought&mdash;granting Miss Durant to be,
      as I well know her to be, one of the most excellent persons who ever lived&mdash;still
      to count the cost of opening such an affair. It is not fair upon a woman
      to bring her into a situation where disappointments may arise which
      neither may be able to bear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you mean my family, Mr. Kendal? Trust me for getting consent from
      home. You will write my father a letter, saying what you said just now;
      Mrs. Kendal will write another to my mother; and I&rsquo;ll just let them see my
      heart is set on it, and they&rsquo;ll not hold out.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Could you bear to see her&mdash;looked down on?&rsquo; said Albinia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ha!&rsquo; he cried, with flashing eyes. &lsquo;No, believe me, Mrs. Kendal, the
      O&rsquo;Mores have too much gentle blood to do like that, even if she were one
      whom any one could scorn. Why, what is my mother herself but a Goldsmith
      by birth, and I&rsquo;d like to see who would cast it up to any of the family
      that she was not as noble as an O&rsquo;More! And Genevieve herself&mdash;isn&rsquo;t
      every look and every movement full of the purest gentility her fathers&rsquo; 
      land can show?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I dare say, once accepted, the O&rsquo;Mores would heartily receive her; but
      here, in this place, there are some might think it told against you, and
      might make her uncomfortable.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What care I? I&rsquo;ve lived and thriven under Bayford scorn many a day. And
      for her&mdash;Oh! I defy anything so base to wound a heart so high as
      hers, and with me to protect her!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you can afford it?&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal. &lsquo;Remember she has her aunt to
      maintain.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can,&rsquo; said Ulick. &lsquo;I have gone over it all again and again; and
      recalling his man-of-business nature, he demonstrated that even at present
      he was well able to support Mdlle. Belmarche, as well as to begin
      housekeeping, and that there was every reason to believe that his wider
      and more intelligent system of management would continue to increase his
      income.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, Ulick,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal at last, &lsquo;I wish you success with all my
      heart, and esteem you for a choice so entirely founded upon the qualities
      most certain to ensure happiness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say that she has not the most glorious eyes, the most
      enchanting figure!&rsquo; exclaimed Ulick, affronted at the compliment that
      seemed to aver that Genevieve&rsquo;s external charms were not equal to her
      sterling merit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kendal and Albinia laughed; and the former excused himself, not quite
      to the lover&rsquo;s satisfaction, by declaring the lady much more attractive
      than many regularly handsome people; but he added, that what he meant was,
      that he was sure the attachment was built upon a sound foundation. Then he
      entreated that Mrs. Kendal would persuade her to listen to him, for she
      had fled from him ever since his betrayal of his sentiments till he was
      half crazed, and had been walking up and down his room all night. He
      should do something distracted, if not relieved from suspense before
      night! And Mr. Kendal got rid of him in the midst of his transports, and
      turning to Albinia said, &lsquo;We must settle this as fast as possible, or he
      will lose his head, and get into a scrape.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do not like such wild behaviour. It is not dignified.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is only temperament,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal. &lsquo;Will you speak to her?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, whenever she comes in.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suspect she has gone out on purpose. Could you not go to find her at
      the school, or wherever she is likely to be?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know where to find her. I cannot give up the children&rsquo;s lessons.
      Nothing hurts Maurice so much as irregularity.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He made no answer, but his look of disappointment excited her to observe
      to herself that she supposed he expected her to run all over the town
      without ordering dinner first, and she wondered how he would like that!
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently she heard him go out at the front door, and felt some
      contrition.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had not the heart to seek Sophy to report progress, and did not see
      her till about eleven o&rsquo;clock, when she came in hastily with her bonnet
      on, asking, &lsquo;Well, mamma?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where have you been, Sophy?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To school,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;Has anything happened?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We have had it out, and I am to speak to her when she comes in,&rsquo; said
      Albinia, glad as perhaps was Sophy of the enigmatical form to which
      Maurice&rsquo;s presence restrained the communication.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy went away, but presently returning and taking up her work, but with
      eyes that betrayed how she was listening; but there was so entire an
      apparent absence of personal suffering, that Albinia began to discharge
      the weight from her mind, and believe that the sentiment had been
      altogether imaginary even on Sophy&rsquo;s side, and the whole a marvellous
      figment of her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, Mr. Kendal&rsquo;s foot was heard; Sophy started up, and sat down
      again. He came upstairs, and his face was all smiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think she will go by the three o&rsquo;clock omnibus.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have spoken to her?&rsquo; cried Albinia in compunction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Has Maurice finished? Then go out, my boy, for the present.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well?&rsquo; said Albinia, interrogatively, and Sophy laid down her work and
      crossed one hand over the other on her knees, and leant back as though to
      hinder visible tremor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he said, going on with what had been deferred till Maurice was
      gone. &lsquo;I thought it hard on him&mdash;and as I was going to speak to
      Edwards, I asked if she were at the Union, where I found her, taking leave
      of the old women, and giving them little packets of snuff, and small
      presents, chiefly her own work, I am sure. I took her with me into the
      fields, and persuaded her at last to talk it over with me. Poor little
      thing! I never saw a more high-minded, conscientious spirit: she was very
      unhappy about it, and said she knew it was all her unfortunate manner, she
      wished to be guarded, but a little excitement and conversation always
      turned her head, and she entreated me not to hinder her going back to a
      school-room, out of the way of every one. I told her that she must not
      blame herself for being more than usually agreeable; but she would not
      listen, and I could hardly bring her to attend to what I said of young
      O&rsquo;More. Poor girl! I believe she was running away from her own heart.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have prevented her?&rsquo; cried Sophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At least I have induced her to hear his arguments. I told her my opinion
      of him, which was hardly needed, and what I thought might have more weight&mdash;that
      he has earned the right to please himself, and that I believed she would
      be better for him than riches. She repeated several times &ldquo;Not now,&rdquo; and
      &ldquo;Not here;&rdquo; and I found that she was shocked at the idea of the subject
      being brought before us. I was obliged to tell her that nothing would
      gratify any of us so much, and that this was the time to fulfil her
      promise of considering me as a father.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, thank you,&rsquo; murmured Sophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So finally I convinced her that she owed Ulick a hearing, and I think she
      felt that to hear was to yield. She had certainly been feeling that flight
      was the only measure, and between her dread of entrapping him and of
      hurting our feelings, had persuaded herself it was her duty. The last
      thing she did was to catch hold of me as I was going, and ask if he knew
      what her father was.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I dare say it has been the first thing she has said to him,&rsquo; said
      Albinia. &lsquo;She is a noble little creature! But what have you done with them
      now?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I brought him to her in the parsonage garden. I believe they are walking
      in the lanes,&rsquo; said Mr. Kendal, much gratified with his morning&rsquo;s work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She deserves him,&rsquo; said Sophy; and then her eyes became set, as if
      looking into far distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The walk in the lanes had not ended by luncheon-time, and an afternoon
      loaded with callers was oppressive, but Sophy kept up well. At last, in
      the twilight, the door was heard to open, and Genevieve came in alone.
      They listened, and knew she must have run up to her own room. What did it
      portend? Albinia must be the one to go and see, so after a due interval,
      she went up and knocked. Genevieve opened the door, and threw herself into
      her arms. &lsquo;Dear Mrs. Kendal! Oh! have I done wrong? I am so very happy,
      and I cannot help it!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia kissed her, and assured her she had done nothing to repent of.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am so glad you think so. I never dreamt such happiness could be meant
      for me, and I am afraid lest I should have been selfish and wrong, and
      bring trouble on him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We have been all saying you deserve him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh no&mdash;no&mdash;so good, so noble, so heroic as he is. How could he
      think of the poor little French teacher! And he will pay my aunt&rsquo;s fifty
      pounds! I told him all, and he knew it before, and yet he loves me! Oh!
      why are people so very good to me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I could easily find an answer to that question,&rsquo; said Albinia. &lsquo;Where is
      he, my dear?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is gone home. I would not come into the town with him. It is nothing,
      you know; no one must hear of it, for he must be free unless his parents
      consent&mdash;and I know they never can,&rsquo; she said, shaking her head,
      sadly, &lsquo;but even then I shall have one secret of happiness&mdash;I shall
      know what has been! But oh! Mrs. Kendal, let me go away&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Go away now?&rsquo; exclaimed Albinia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes&mdash;it cannot be&mdash;here, in this house! Oh! it is outraging
      your kindness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Albinia; &lsquo;it is but letting us fulfil a very precious charge.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Genevieve&rsquo;s tears flowed as she said, &lsquo;Such goodness! Mr. Kendal spoke to
      me in this way in the morning, when he was more kind and patient than I
      can express. But tell me, dearest madame, tell me candidly, is my
      remaining here the cause of any secret pain to him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With regard to him, Albinia could answer sincerely that it was a
      gratification; and Genevieve owned that she should be glad to await the
      letters from Ireland, which she tried to persuade herself she believed
      would put an end to everything, except the precious remembrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy here came in with some tea. She had recollected that Genevieve had
      wandered all day without any bodily sustenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was great sweetness in the quiet, grave manner in which she bent
      over her friend and kissed her brow. All she said was, &lsquo;Papa had goes to
      fetch him to dinner. Genevieve, you must let me do your hair.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in Genevieve&rsquo;s eyes an astonishing fancy, and Albinia said, &lsquo;Come
      away now, my dear; she must have a thorough rest after such a day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Genevieve looked too much excited for rest, but that was the more reason
      for leaving her to herself; and besides, it was so uncomfortable not to be
      able to be kind enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, when people are happy, a little kindness goes a great way, and
      there was a subdued lustre like a glory in her eyes when she came
      downstairs, with the holly leaves and berries glistening in her hair, the
      first ornament she had ever worn there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was Sophy&rsquo;s doing,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;Naughty girl; she tried to take me by
      surprise. She would not let me look in the glass, but I guessed&mdash;and
      oh! she was wounding her poor hands so sadly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I must thank her,&rsquo; said Ulick, looking ecstatic. &lsquo;Why does she not come
      down?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As she did not appear, Albinia went up, doubtful if it were wise, yet too
      uneasy not to go in quest of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was startling to have so faint an answer on knocking, and on entering
      the room, she saw Sophy lying on her bed, upon her back, with her arms by
      her sides, and with a ghastly whiteness on her features.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely a pulse could be felt, and her hands were icy cold, her voice
      sank to nothing, her eyelids scarcely raised, as if the strain of the day
      had exhausted all vital warmth or energy, and her purpose accomplished,
      annihilation was succeeding. Much terrified, Albinia would have hurried in
      search of remedies, but she raised her hand imploringly, and murmured,
      &lsquo;Please don&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m not faint&mdash;I&rsquo;m not ill. If you would only let me
      be still.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia teased her so far as to cover her with warmed shawls, and force on
      her a stimulant. She shut her eyes, but presently opened them to say,
      &lsquo;Please go.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She was so often unable to appear at dinner, that no observation was made;
      and it was to be feared that her absence was chiefly regretted by the
      lovers, because it prevented them from sitting on the same side of the
      table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Always frank and unrestrained, Ulick made his felicity so apparent, that
      Albinia had no toleration for him, and not much for the amusement it
      afforded Mr. Kendal. She would have approved of her husband much more if
      he had put her into a great quandary by anxious inquiries what was the
      matter with his daughter, instead of that careless, &lsquo;O you are going up to
      Sophy; I hope she will be able to come down to tea,&rsquo; when she left him on
      guard over the children and the lovers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So it is with woman&rsquo;s martyrdoms,&rsquo; said she to herself as she walked
      upstairs, chewing the cud of all the commonplaces by which women have, of
      late years, flattered themselves, and been flattered; &lsquo;but at any rate
      I&rsquo;ll have her out of sight of all their absurdity. It is enough to kill
      her!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophy hardly stirred at her entrance, but there was less ghastliness about
      her, and as Albinia sat down she did not remove her hand, and turned
      slightly round, so as to lose that strange corpse-like attitude of repose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are not so cold, dearest,&rsquo; said Albinia. &lsquo;Have you slept?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think not.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you better? Have you been comfortable?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh yes.&rsquo; Then, with a pause, &lsquo;Yes&mdash;it was like being nothing!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You were not faint, I hope?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No&mdash;only lying still. Don&rsquo;t you know the comfort of not thinking or
      feeling?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes; this has been far too much for you. You have done enough now, my
      generous Sophy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not generous; one can&rsquo;t give away what one never had.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think it more gracious to yield without jealousy or bitterness&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only not quite base,&rsquo; said Sophy. Then presently, turning on her pillow
      as though more willing to converse, she said, &lsquo;I am glad it was not last
      year.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We had troubles enough then!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not for that&mdash;because I should have been base then, and hated myself
      for it all the time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That you never could have been!&rsquo; cried Albinia. &lsquo;But, my dear, you must
      let me contrive for you; I would not betray you for all the world, but the
      sight of these two is more than you ought to undergo. I will not send
      Genevieve away, but you must go from home.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think I shall be cross,&rsquo; said poor Sophy, simply; &lsquo;I should be
      ashamed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Cross! It is I who am cross, because I am to blame; but, dearest, think
      if you are keeping up out of pride; that will never, never do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do not believe it is pride,&rsquo; said Sophy, meekly; &lsquo;at least, I hope not.
      I feel humiliated enough, and I think it may be a sort of shame, as well
      as consideration for them, that would make me wish that no difference
      should be made. Do you not think we may let things go on?&rsquo; she said, in so
      humble a manner, that it brought Albinia&rsquo;s tears, and a kiss was the only
      answer. &lsquo;Please tell me,&rsquo; said Sophy; &lsquo;for I don&rsquo;t want to deceive
      myself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am sure I am no judge,&rsquo; cried Albinia, &lsquo;after the dreadful mischief I
      have done.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The mischief was in me,&rsquo; said Sophy, &lsquo;or you could not have done it. I
      saw it all when I was lying awake last night, and how it began, or rather
      it was before I can remember exactly. I always had craving after something&mdash;a
      yearning for something to fix myself on&mdash;and after I grew to read and
      look out into the world, I thought it must be that. And when I knew I was
      ugly and disagreeable, I brooded and brooded, and only in my better
      moments tried to be satisfied with you and papa and the children.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And the All-satisfying, Sophy dear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I tried&mdash;I did&mdash;but it was duty&mdash;not heart. I used to
      fancy what might be, if I shot out into beauty and grace&mdash;not
      admiration, but to have that one thing to lean on. You see it was all
      worldly, and only submissive by fits&mdash;generally it was cross
      repining, yielding because I could not help it&mdash;and so, when the
      fancy came the throne was ready made, empty, swept, and garnished, for the
      idol. I wont talk of all that time; but I don&rsquo;t believe even Genevieve,
      though she knows she may, can dwell upon the thought as I did, in just the
      way to bring punishment. And so I thought, by-and-by, at the caricature
      time, that I was punished. I looked into the fallacy, when I had got over
      the temper and the pride, and I saw it all clear, and owned I was rightly
      served, for it had been an earthly aim, and an idol worship. Well, the
      foolish hope came back again, but indeed, indeed, I think I was the better
      for all the chastening; I had seen grandmamma die, I was fresh from
      hearing of Gilbert, and I did feel as I never had done before, that God
      was first. I don&rsquo;t believe that feeling had passed, though the folly came
      back, and made me feel glad to love all the world. There were&mdash;gleams
      of religions thought&rsquo;&mdash;she spoke with difficulty, but her face had a
      strange beauty&mdash;&lsquo;that taught me how, if I was more good&mdash;there
      could be a fulness of joy that all the rest flowed out from. And so when
      misgivings came, and I saw at times how little he could care for me&mdash;oh!
      it was pain enough, but not the worst sort. And yet I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;&rsquo; 
      She turned away and hid her face on the pillow. It was agony, though
      still, as she had said, not the worst, untempered by faith or resignation.
      What a history of that apparently cold, sullen, impassive spirit! what an
      unlocking of pent-up mysteries!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It has been blessed to you,&rsquo; said Albinia, affectionately. &lsquo;My dear, we
      always thought your character one that wanted the softening of such&mdash;an
      attachment. Perhaps that made me wrongly eager for it, and ready to
      imagine where I ought not; I think it did soften you; but if you had not
      conquered what was earthly and exaggerated in it, how it would be
      hardening and poisoning you now!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope I may have,&rsquo; sighed Sophy, as if she were doubtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then will you not listen to me? You have done nobly so far, and I know
      your feelings will be right in the main; but do you think you can bear the
      perpetual irritation of being neglected, and seeing&mdash;what I <i>must</i>
      call rather a parade of his preference?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think it would be the best cure,&rsquo; said Sophy; &lsquo;it would make me feel it
      real, and I could be glad to see him&mdash;them&mdash;so happy&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know how to judge! I don&rsquo;t know whether it be right for you to
      have him always before your mind.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He would be so all the more while I was away with nothing to do,&rsquo; said
      Sophy; &lsquo;fancy might be worse than fact. You don&rsquo;t know how I used to
      forget the nonsense when he had been ten minutes in the room, because it
      was just starved out. Now, when it will be a sin, I believe that strength
      will be given me to root it out;&rsquo; her look grew determined, but she gasped
      for breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And your bodily strength, my dear?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I should be ill, then it would be natural to go away,&rsquo; said Sophy,
      smiling; &lsquo;but I don&rsquo;t think I shall be. This is only the end of my fever
      to see it settled. Now I am thankful, and my heart has left off throbbing
      when I am still. I shall be all right to-morrow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope so; but you must spare yourself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Besides,&rsquo; she added, &lsquo;one of the worst parts has been that, in the fancy
      that a change was to come, I have gone about everything in an unsettled
      way; and now I want to begin again at my duties, my readings and parish
      matters, as my life&rsquo;s work, steadily and in earnest.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not violently, not to drive care away.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have tried that once, and will not again. You shall arrange for me, and
      I will do just as you tell me;&rsquo; and she raised her eyes with the most deep
      and earnest gaze of confiding love that had ever greeted Albinia from any
      of the three. I&rsquo;ll try not to grieve you, for you are too sorry for me;&rsquo; 
      and she threw her arms round her neck. &lsquo;Oh, mamma! nothing is so bad when
      you help me to bear it!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Tears fell fast at this precious effusion from the deep, sincere heart, at
      the moment when Albinia herself was most guilty in her own eyes. Embraces
      were her only answer, and how fervent!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And, mamma,&rsquo; whispered Sophy, &lsquo;if you could only let me have some small
      part of teaching little Albinia.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A trotting of small feet and a call of mamma was heard. The little maiden
      was come with her good-nights, and in one moment Albinia had lifted her
      into her sister&rsquo;s arms, where she was devoured with kisses, returning them
      with interest, and with many a fondling &lsquo;Poor Sophy,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Dear Sophy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      When the last fond good-night had passed, and the little one had gone away
      to her nest, Sophy said in a soft, natural, unconstrained voice, &lsquo;I am
      very sleepy. If you will be so kind as to send up my tea, I will go to
      bed. Thank you; goodnight.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      That was the redrawing of the curtain of reserve, the resignation of
      sentiment, the resumption of common life. The romance of Sophia Kendal&rsquo;s
      early life had ended when she wounded her fingers in wreathing Genevieve&rsquo;s
      hair. Her next romance might be on behalf of her beautiful little sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia was cured of her fretfulness towards the new order of events, and
      her admiration of Sophy carried her through all that was yet to come. It
      was the easier since Sophy did not insist on unreasonable self-martyrdoms,
      and in her gratitude for being allowed her purpose in the main, was
      submissive in detail, and had mercy on her own powers of endurance, not
      inflicting the sight of the lovers on herself more than was needful, and
      not struggling with the languor that was a good reason for remaining much
      upstairs. She worked and read, but without overdoing anything, and wisely
      undertook a French translation, as likely to occupy her attention without
      forcing her to over-exert her powers. Not that she said so; she carefully
      avoided all reference to her feelings; and Albinia could almost have
      deemed the whole a dream, excepting for the occasional detection of a
      mournful fixed gaze, which was instantaneously winked away as soon as
      Sophy herself became aware of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her trouble, though of a kind proverbially the most hardening and
      exacerbating, had an entirely contrary tendency on her. The rigidity and
      harsh judgment which had betokened her states of morbid depression since
      she had outgrown the sulky form, had passed away, and she had been right
      in predicting that she should not be cross, for she had become sweet and
      gentle towards all. Her voice was pitched more softly, and though she
      looked ill, and had lost the bloom which had once given her a sort of
      beauty, her eyes had a meek softness that made them finer than when they
      wore the stern, steady glance that used to make poor Gilbert quail. Her
      strength came not from pride, but from Grace; and to her, disappointment
      was more softening than even the prosperous affection that Albinia had
      imagined. It was love; not earthly but heavenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      If her father had been less busy, her pale cheek might have alarmed him;
      but he was very much taken up with builders and estimates, with persuading
      some of the superfluous population to emigrate, and arranging where they
      should go, and while she kept the family hours and habits, he did not
      notice lesser indications of flagging spirits, or if he did, he was wise,
      and thought the cause had better not be put into words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia had brought herself to give fair sympathy to the lovers; and when
      once she had begun it was easy to go on, not as ardently as if she had
      never indulged in her folly, but enough to gratify two such happy and
      grateful people, who wanted no one but each other, and agreed in nothing
      better than in thinking her a sort of guardian angel to them both.
    </p>
    <p>
      Genevieve had assuredly never given her heart to Gilbert, and it was ready
      in all the freshness of maidenly bliss to meet the manly ardour of Ulick
      O&rsquo;More. He was almost overpoweringly demonstrative and eager, now and then
      making game of himself, but yet not able to help rushing down to Willow
      Lawn ten or twelve times a day, just to satisfy himself that his treasure
      was there, and if he could not meet with her, catching hold of Mr. or Mrs.
      Kendal to rave till they drove him back to his business. Such glee danced
      in his eyes, there was such suppressed joyousness in his countenance, and
      his step was so much nearer a dance than a walk, that his very air
      well-nigh betrayed what was to be an absolute secret, till there had been
      an answer from Ballymakilty, until which time Genevieve would not rest in
      the hope of a happy future, nor give up her fears that she had not brought
      pain upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In he came at last, so exulting and so grateful, that it was a shock to
      discover that &lsquo;the kindest letter and fullest consent in the world,&rsquo; meant
      his father&rsquo;s &lsquo;supposing he would do as he pleased; as long as he asked for
      nothing, it was no concern of his.&rsquo; It was discovered, by Ulick&rsquo;s delight,
      that he had expected to have a battle, and Albinia was scandalized, but
      Mr. Kendal told her it somewhat depended on what manner of father it was,
      whether an independent son could defer implicitly to his judgment; and
      though principle might withhold Ulick from flat disobedience, he might not
      scruple at extorting reluctant consent. Besides his mother, whom he
      honoured far more really, had written, not without disappointment, but
      with full confidence in his ability to judge for himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kendal and Mr. Ferrars both wrote warmly in Genevieve&rsquo;s praise, and
      certainly her footing at Willow Lawn was the one point d&rsquo;appui in bringing
      round the O&rsquo;More family; so that as Ulick truly said, &lsquo;It was Mrs. Kendal
      whom he had to thank for the blessing of his life.&rsquo; Had poor Miss
      Goldsmith&rsquo;s description of Miss Durant&rsquo;s birth, parentage, and education
      been the only one that had reached Ballymakilty, a prohibition would
      assuredly have been issued; but he was left sufficiently free to satisfy
      his own conscience, and before Genevieve had surmounted half her scruples,
      the whole town was ringing with the news, though no one could guess how it
      had got wind. To be sure the Dusautoys had been put into a state of
      rapture, and poor Mr. Hope had had the fatal stroke administered to him.
      He looked so like a ghost that Mr. Dusautoy contrived to release him at
      once, whereupon he went to try the most unwholesome curacy he could find,
      with serious intentions of exchanging his living for it; but he
      fortunately became so severely and helplessly ill there, that he was
      pretty well cured of his mental fever, and quite content to go to his
      heath, and do his work there like the humble and earnest man that he was,
      perhaps all the better for having been personally taught something more
      than could be gained from books and colleges.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Goldsmith was the most to be pitied. She would not hear a word from
      her nephew, refused to go near Willow Lawn, packed up her goods and went
      to Bath, where Ulick promised the much distressed Genevieve that she would
      yet relent. Genevieve was somewhat consoled by the increasing cordiality
      of the Irish letters, and was carried along by the extreme delight and
      triumph of her good old aunt. By some wonderful exertion of Irish
      faculties, Ulick succeeded in bringing mademoiselle to Bayford in his
      jaunting car, when she laughed, wept, sobbed, and embraced, in a
      bewilderment of transport; pronounced the trousseau worthy of an angel of
      the ancien regime; warned Genevieve against expecting amour to continue
      instead of amitie, and carried home conversation for the nuns for the rest
      of their lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      That trousseau was Sophy&rsquo;s special charge, and most jealous was she that
      it should in no respect fall short of that outfit of Lucy&rsquo;s for which she
      had cared so little. A hard task it was to make Genevieve accept what Lucy
      had exacted, but Sophy held the purse-strings, wrote the orders, and had
      her own way.
    </p>
    <p>
      She and her little sister were the only available bridesmaids, since Rose
      O&rsquo;More was not allowed to come. Having made up her mind to this from the
      first, when the subject came forward, her open, cheerful look and manner
      were meant to show that she was not afraid, and that her wish was real.
      Freely resigning him, why should she not be glad to join in calling down
      the blessing?
    </p>
    <p>
      The wedding was fixed for Easter week, which fell early, and Albinia cast
      about for some excuse for taking her away afterwards. An opportune
      occasion offered. Sir William Ferrars wrote from the East to propose the
      Kendals meeting him in Italy, and travelling home together, he was
      longing, he said, to see something of his sister, and he should enjoy
      sight-seeing ten times as much with a clever man like her husband to tell
      him all about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ferrars strongly seconded the project! Clever fellow, not a word did
      he say; but did not he know the secrets of that household as well or
      better than the inmates themselves?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that Tibb&rsquo;s Alley was deserted, and plans fixed, architect and clerk
      of the works chosen, March winds ready for building and underground work
      to begin at once, what could be more prudent than for the inhabitants of
      Willow Lawn to remove far from the disturbance of ancient drains and no
      drains, and betake themselves to a purer atmosphere? Mr. Kendal was of no
      use as a superintendent, and needed no persuasion to flee from the chance
      of typhus.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the children, the time had come early when Maurice&rsquo;s whole nature
      cried out for school. He was much improved, and there was that real
      principle within him which made it not unsafe to launch him in a world
      where he might meet with more useful trials than those of home. Child as
      he was, his propensities were too much limited by the bounds of the
      town-house and garden, and the society of his sisters, one too old and one
      too young to serve as tomboys. He needed to meet his match, and work his
      way; Albinia felt that school had become his element, and Mr. Kendal only
      wanted to make his education the reverse of Gilbert&rsquo;s; so he ran nearly
      frantic between the real jacket and the promise of going to school with
      Willie. He knew not, though his mother mourned over, the coming
      heart-sickness and mother-sickness of the first night, the first Sunday,
      the first trouble. It was sure to be very severe in one of such strong and
      affectionate feeling, but it must come sooner or later, and the better
      that it should be conquered while home was still a paradise. Fairmead was
      not so far from his destination but that his uncle would keep an eye on
      him; and Winifred held out a hope that if the tour lasted long enough, he
      should bring out both boys to spend their holidays with them. A very good
      Winifred!
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia the Less was to become a traveller, for the good reason that
      nobody could or would go without her. They were to go direct to Lucy, who
      was at Naples with a second boy, and pining for home faces and home
      comforts&mdash;the inducement which perhaps worked most strongly to make
      Sophy like the journey, for since her delusion had been swept, away, a
      doubly deep and intense feeling had sprung up towards her own only sister,
      whose foibles had been forgotten in long separation.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Lake of Lucerne lay blue and dark in the shade of the mountains, on
      whose summits the evening sunshine was fast mounting, peak after peak
      falling into purple shadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a small inlet where a stream rushed down between the hills, and
      on the green slope stood a chalet, the rich red of the roof contrasting
      with the green pasture. A little boat was moored to a stump near the land,
      and in it sat Sophia Kendal, her hat by her side, listening to and
      answering merrily the chatter of Maurice, who tumbled about in the boat,
      often causing it severe shocks, while he inspected the cut of the small
      sail which she was making for the miniature specimen, which he often tried
      in the clear cold water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Farther off, a little up the hill-side, Willie Ferrars was holding the
      hand of the chestnut-curled, black-eyed fairy, &lsquo;little Awk,&rsquo; who was
      impressing him by her fluency in two languages at once, according as she
      chattered to him in English, or in French to a picturesque peasant, her
      great ally, who was mowing his flowery crop of hay, glancing like an
      illumination, with an under-current of brilliant blossoms among the grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wandering with slow conversational pace up and down the beach of the lake,
      were Mr. Kendal and Sir William Ferrars, conversing as usual; the soldier,
      with quick alert comprehension, wide observation, and clearness of mind,
      which jumped to the very points to which the scholar&rsquo;s deeply-read and
      long-digested arguments were bringing him more slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a projecting point sat Albinia, her fair hair shaded under her dark
      hat, beneath which her English complexion glowed fresh and youthful, as
      with flat tin box by her side, and block sketch-book on her knee, she
      mixed and she painted, and tried to catch those purples and those blues
      with unabated ardour. Suddenly a great trailing frond of mountain fern
      came over the brim of her hat from behind. &lsquo;Oh, Maurice, don&rsquo;t!&rsquo; Then,
      looking up and laughing, &lsquo;Oh, it is you, is it? I knew Maurice would do,
      whichever it might be; but see, the other is quite out of mischief.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Unless he should upset Sophy into the lake.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He can&rsquo;t do that, the rope is too short. But is not he very much
      improved? He has quite lost his imperious manner towards her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing like school for making a boy behave himself to his sisters.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Exactly, as I learnt by experience long ago. I am glad William did not
      see him till he had learnt to be agreeable. How he does admire him!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll never make anything of that sketch; the mountain is humpbacked,
      and the face of that precipice is exactly like Colonel Bury;&rsquo; and he
      caught up a pencil to help out the resemblance with nostril and eyebrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For shame, to be so mischievous; such a great boy as you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, we all came out here to be great boys, didn&rsquo;t we? I am sure you
      look a dozen years younger than when I last saw you, Mrs. Grandmother.
      By-the-by, it was a bold stroke to encumber yourself with that brat;
      what&rsquo;s become of him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Susan has taken him in asleep. You see, Maurice, I really could not help
      it, the poor little thing was so sickly, and had never thriven; but when
      they were a little while in bracing air, Lucy was longing to have him in
      England, and his father, who never believes in anything but what he likes,
      <i>would</i> not see it, and what with those Italian servants, and
      Algernon hunting Lucy about as he does, it would have been the death of
      him. Susan, good creature, had taken to him of her own accord the moment
      we came to Naples, and could not have borne to leave him, and you know the
      Awk is almost off her hands now, and Sophy, who first proposed it, or I am
      sure I should never have ventured, is delighted to do anything for either
      of them, and always has her little sister in her room. As to papa, he was
      very good, and the child is very little in his way, and has been quite
      well ever since we have been in this delicious air.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How did you get Lucy to consent?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor dear, it was a melancholy business; but she had so often been in
      alarm about him, and had suffered so much from having to leave him with
      people she did not trust, that she caught at the proposal before she
      fairly contemplated what the parting would be; and when she did, Algernon
      was too glad to be relieved from him not to keep her up to it, but it wont
      do to think of it, she has her baby, who is healthier, and if they remain
      abroad, I suspect we shall keep little Ralph altogether; he is a dear
      little fellow, and Sophy has so taken possession of Albinia, that I should
      be quite lost if I did not set up a private child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you call him? I thought his name was Belraven.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I could not possibly call him so; and his aunts, by way of adding to the
      aviary, made him Ralph the Raven, so I mean it to stick by him; I believe
      papa has forgotten the other dreadful fact, for I caught him giving his
      name as Ralph Cavendish Dusautoy. How the dear vicar of Bayford will
      devour him! and what work I shall have to keep him from being spoilt!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you think they will remain abroad?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Algernon hates England; and all his habits are foreign.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did he make himself tolerably agreeable?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He really did. One could bear to be patronized by one&rsquo;s host better than
      by one&rsquo;s guest, and he was in wholesome awe of William. Besides, he is
      really at home in Italy, and knows his way about so well, that he was not
      a bad Cicerone. I am sure Sophy could never have done either Vesuvius or
      Pompeii without his arrangements; and as long as he had a victim for his
      catalogue raisonnee, he was very placable and obliging. That was all
      extracts, so it really was not so bad.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So you were satisfied?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He has a bad lot about him, that&rsquo;s the worst&mdash;Polish counts,
      disreputable artists and poets, any one who has a spurious sort of fame,
      and knows how to flatter him. Edmund was terribly disgusted.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very bad for his wife.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You see, she is a thorough-going mother, and no linguist. She really is
      improved, and I like her more really than ever I could, poor dear. I
      believe her head was once quite turned, and that he influenced her
      entirely, and made her forget everything else; but she has a heart, though
      not much of a head, and sorrow and illness and children have brought it
      out, and she is what a &lsquo;very woman&rsquo; becomes, I suppose, if there be any
      good in her, an abstract wife and mother.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Was it not dangerous to take away her child?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There was another, you know, and it was to save his life. The duties
      clashed, and were destroying all comfort.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How does he behave to her?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I believe she has all the love he has to spare; he is proud of her, and
      dresses her up, and has endless portraits of her. Luckily she keeps her
      beauty. She is more refined, and has more expression; one could sometimes
      cry to watch her, and he likes to have her with him, and to discourse to
      her, but without the slightest perception or consideration of what she
      would prefer, and with no notion of sacrificing anything for her or the
      children. I know she is afraid of him; I have seen her tremble if there
      were any chance of his being annoyed; and she would not object to any plan
      of his if it were to cost her life. I believe it would be misery to her,
      but I think she would resist&mdash;ay, she <i>did</i> resist, and in vain,
      for the sake of her child.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Does her affection hold out, do you think?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, yes, the spaniel and walnut-tree love, which is in us all, and doubly
      in the very woman. It is very beautiful. She is so proud of him and of her
      gilded slavery, and so unconsciously submissive and patient; but it is a
      harder life, I guess, than we can see. I am sure it must be, for every bit
      of personal vanity and levity is worn out of her; she only goes out to
      satisfy him; dresses to please his eye, and talks, with her eye seeking
      round for him, in dread of being rebuked for mistakes or bad French. And
      for the rest, her joy is to be left in peace with little Algernon upon her
      lap. Yes, I hope living in all womanly virtues may be training and
      compensation, but the saddest part of the affair is that he does not think
      it fashionable to be religious, and she has not moral courage to make open
      resistance.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;May it come,&rsquo; fervently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is strange, how much more real and good a creature she is now, than
      when at home in the midst of all external observances. Yet it cannot be
      right! she surely ought to make more stand, but it is too, too literally
      being afraid to say her soul is her own, for she is unhappy. She does the
      utmost she can without offending him, and feels it as she never did
      before.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is no judging,&rsquo; said Maurice, as his sister looked at him with eyes
      full of sorrowful yearning. &lsquo;No one can tell where are the boundaries of
      the two duties. Poor girl! she has put herself into a state of temptation
      and trial; but she may be shielded by her exercise of so much that is
      simply good, and her womanly qualities may become not idolatry, but a
      training in reaching higher.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;May it be so, indeed!&rsquo; said Albinia. &lsquo;Oh, Maurice! how I once disdained
      being told I was too young, and how true it was! What visions I had about
      those three, and what failures have resulted!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your visions may have vanished, but you did your work faithfully, and it
      has not been fruitless.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ay, in shipwrecked lives. Mischiefs wherever I meant to do best! Why, I
      let even my own Maurice grow unmanageable while I was nursing poor
      grandmamma. The voluntary duty choked the natural one, and yet&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And yet,&rsquo; interrupted her brother, &lsquo;that was no error.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, no! I would not have done it for anything.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nor do I think the boy the worse for it. I may venture now on saying he
      was intolerable, and it hastened school, but though your rein was loose,
      you never let it fall; and maybe, the self-conquest was the best thing for
      him. If you had neglected him wilfully for your own pleasure, nothing but
      harm could have been expected. As you were absorbed by a sacred act of
      duty, I believe it will all be made up to you in your son.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, Maurice, if I might trust so! I believe I am doubly set on that boy
      doing well, because his father must not, <i>must</i> not have another
      pang!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think he knows that. I do not imagine that he will never be carried
      astray by high spirits; but I am sure that he has the strength, honour,
      and sweetness that are the elements of greatness!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing we did so changed him as the loss of his brother. Oh, Maurice!
      there was my most earnest wish to do right, and my most fatal mistake!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And greatest success. Gilbert owed everything to you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Had I but silenced my foolish pride, he might have been safe in India
      now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We do not know how safe he might be. I did indeed think it a pity your
      influence led the other way, but things might have been far worse; if you
      made some blunders, your love and your earnestness were working on that
      susceptible nature, and what better hope can we wish to have than what
      rested with us at Malta? what better influence than has remained with
      Maurice or with Fred?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Albinia had not yet learnt to talk calmly of Gilbert&rsquo;s last hours, so she
      put this aside, and smiling through her tears, said, &lsquo;Ah! when Emily
      writes to Sophy, that their boy is to have his name, since they can wish
      nothing better for him than to be like him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The past vision always a little above what is visible?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hardly, Emily and Fred are as proud of each other as two peacocks, and
      well they may be, for&mdash;stoop down, &lsquo;tis an intense secret; but do you
      know the effect of their Sebastopol den?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lieutenant-General Sir William Ferrars is going out in quest of Emily&rsquo;s
      younger sister.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You ridiculous child! That&rsquo;s a trick of yours.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, indeed. William was surprised into a moment of confidence, walking
      home in the moonlight from the Coliseum. En vrai militaire, he has begun
      at the right end, and written to Mr. Kinnaird to ask leave to come and try
      his luck; and cool as he looks, I believe he would rather prepare for
      Inkermann.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well! if he be not making a fool of himself at his time of life, I am
      sure I am very glad!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Time of life! He&rsquo;s but three years older than Edmund. If you are not more
      respectful, we shall have to go out to Canada to countenance him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall be rejoiced to see him with a home, and finding life beyond his
      profession; but I had rather he had known more of her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s what he never would do. He cannot talk to a young lady. Why he
      admires Lucy a great deal more than Sophy!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, judging by the recent brides, I think if it had been me, I should
      have gone in search of Mrs. Ulick O&rsquo;More&rsquo;s younger sister.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! I wanted particularly to hear of your visit at the bank. You had
      luncheon there, I think. How do they get on?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is the most charming menage in the world. She looks very graceful and
      elegant, and keeps him in great order, and is just the wife he wanted&mdash;a
      little sauciness and piquancy to spur him up at one time, and restrain him
      at another, with the real ballast that both have, makes such a perfect
      compound, that it is only too delightful to see anything so happy and so
      good in this world. They both seem to have such vivid enjoyment of life.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pray, has any one called on Genevieve? though she could dispense with
      it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, yes; Bryan O&rsquo;More spent a fortnight there. And see what a moustache
      will do! The Osbornes, Drurys, Wolfes, and Co., all dubbed themselves dear
      Mrs. O&rsquo;More&rsquo;s dearest friends. I found a circle of them round her, and
      when I observed that Bryan was not half such a handsome fellow as his
      brother, you should see how I was scorned.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope Bryan may not play his father&rsquo;s game again. Do you know how she
      was received in Ireland?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The whole clan adore her! Ulick, with, his Anglo-Saxon truthfulness, got
      into serious scrapes for endeavouring to disabuse them of the notion that
      she was sole heiress of the ancient marquisate of Durant. I believe Connel
      was ready to call Ulick out for disrespect to his own wife.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And was she happy there!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very much amused, and treated like a queen; charmed with his mother, and
      great friends with Rose. They have brought Redmond home to lick him into
      shape, and I believe Rose is to come and be tamed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Always Ulick&rsquo;s wish,&rsquo; said Albinia, as her eye fixed upon Sophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      And her brother, with perhaps too obvious a connexion of ideas, said, &lsquo;Is
      <i>she</i> quite strong?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; said Albinia. &lsquo;I am glad we brought her. The sight of beauty
      has been like a new existence. I saw it on her brow, in calmness and rest,
      the first evening of the Bay of Naples. It has seemed to soothe and
      elevate her, though all in her own silent way; but watch her as she sits
      with her face to those mountains, hear her voice, and you will feel that
      the presence of grandeur and beauty is repose and happiness to her; and I
      think the remembrance will always be so, even in work-a-day Bayford.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, because remembrance of such glory connects with hope of future
      glory.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And it is a rest from human frets and passions. She has taken to botany,
      too, and I am glad, for I think those studies that draw one off from men&rsquo;s
      works and thoughts, do most good to the weary, self-occupied brain. And
      the children are a delight to her!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sophy is your greatest work.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not mine!&rsquo; cried Albinia. &lsquo;The noblest by nature, the dearest, the most
      generous.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Great qualities; but they would have been only wretched self-preying
      torments, but for the softening of your affection,&rsquo; said Maurice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear, dear friend and sister and child in one,&rsquo; cried Albinia. And then
      meeting her brother&rsquo;s eyes, she said, &lsquo;Yes, you know to the full how noble
      she is, and how&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can guess how imprudent a young step-mother can be,&rsquo; said Maurice,
      smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is very strange. I don&rsquo;t, know how to be thankful enough for it; but
      really her spirits have been more equal, her temper more even than ever it
      had been, and that just when I thought my folly had been most ruinous.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, Albinia. After all, it is more than man can hope or expect to make
      no blunders; but I do verily believe that while an earnest will saves us,
      by God&rsquo;s grace, from wilful sins, the effects of the inadvertences that
      teach us our secret faults will not be fatal, and while we are indeed
      honestly and faithfully doing our best, though we are truly unprofitable
      servants, that our lapses through infirmity will be compensated, both in
      the training of our own character and the results upon others.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If we are indeed faithfully doing our best,&rsquo; repeated Albinia.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE END.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo;, WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
